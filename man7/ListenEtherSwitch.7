.SH "DESCRIPTION"
A version of EtherSwitch with a listen port.  Where EtherSwitch has exactly as
many inputs as it has outputs, \fBListenEtherSwitch\fR has one more output than it
has inputs.  This last output is the listen port; a copy of every received
packet is sent to that port.  In an element with N inputs and N+1 outputs, the
(N+1)th output is the listen port.  See EtherSwitch for more information.
