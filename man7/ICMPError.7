.SH "NAME"
ICMPError \- Click element;
generates ICMP error packets
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBICMPError\fR(SRC, TYPE [, CODE, \fIkeywords\fR BADADDRS, MTU])

\fBPorts\fR: 1 input, 1 output

\fBProcessing\fR: agnostic

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Generate an ICMP error packet, with specified TYPE and CODE,
in response to an incoming IP packet. The output is an IP/ICMP packet.
The ICMP packet's IP source address is set to SRC.
The error packet will include (as payload)
the original packet's IP header and an initial segment of its
IP payload. \fBICMPError\fR sets the packet destination IP annotation and,
optionally, the fix_ip_src annotation.
.PP
TYPE and CODE may be integers between 0 and 255 or mnemonic names; CODE
defaults to 0. Valid named TYPEs are `unreachable' [3], `sourcequench' [4],
`redirect' [5], `timeexceeded' [11], and `parameterproblem' [12]. Valid
named CODEs are `net' [0], `host' [1], `protocol' [2], `port' [3], and
`needfrag' [4] for `unreachable'; `net' [0] and `host' [1] for `redirect';
`transit' [0] and `reassembly' [1] for `timeexceeded'; and `erroratptr'
[0], `missingopt' [1], and `length' [2] for `parameterproblem'.
.PP
The intent is that elements that give rise to errors, like 
.M DecIPTTL 7 ,
should have two outputs, one of which is connected to an \fBICMPError\fR.
Perhaps the \fBICMPError\fR should be followed by a rate limiting
element.
.PP
\fBICMPError\fR never generates a packet in response to an ICMP error packet, a
fragment, or a link broadcast. The BADADDRS keyword argument supplies an
optional list of bad IP addresses; if it is present, then \fBICMPError\fR doesn't
generate packets in response to packets with one of those addresses as
either source or destination.
.PP
The output of \fBICMPError\fR should be connected to the routing lookup
machinery, much as if the ICMP errors came from a hardware interface.
.PP
If TYPE is 12 (`parameterproblem') and CODE is 0 (`erroratptr'), \fBICMPError\fR
takes the error pointer from the packet's ICMP parameter problem
annotation. The 
.M IPGWOptions 7
element sets the annotation.
.PP
If TYPE is 5 (`redirect'), produces an ICMP redirect message. The gateway
address is taken from the destination annotation. Usually a Paint-PaintTee
element pair hands the packet to a redirect \fBICMPError\fR. RFC1812 says only
code 1 (`host') should be used.
.PP
If TYPE is 3 ('unreachable') and CODE is 4 ('needfrag'), produces
an ICMP unreachable message containing the MTU of the next-hop
interface, specified by the PMTU keyword. This error should be
returned to the sender of an IP packet with the DF bit set, that is
longer than the next-hop MTU, to support Path MTU Discovery.
.PP
If the input packet has a source route option, the output packet will also
have a source route option, containing the routers from the input source
route, reversed.
.PP
Will not generate a packet larger than MTU, which defaults to 576.
.PP
Keyword arguments are:
.PP


.IP "BADADDRS" 8
A list of source IP addresses for which ICMP errors should not be
generated.  Usually the limited broadcast address(es) of the current
subnet.
.IP "" 8
.IP "MTU" 8
Unsigned.  The maximum error packet size generated.  Defaults to 576.
.IP "" 8
.IP "PMTU" 8
Unsigned.  The maximum MTU for the path, reported in unreachable messages.
.IP "" 8
.IP "USE_FIX_ANNO" 8
Boolean.  If false, do not set the fix_ip_src annotation on output packets.
Defaults to true.
.IP "" 8
.PP

.SH "EXAMPLES"
This configuration fragment produces ICMP Time Exceeded error
messages in response to TTL expirations, but limits the
rate at which such messages can be sent to 10 per second:
.PP
.nf
\& dt : DecIPTTL;
\& dt[1] -> ICMPError(18.26.4.24, timeexceeded) -> m :: RatedSplitter(10) -> ...
\& m[1] -> Discard;
.fi
.PP



.SH "NOTES"
\fBICMPError\fR can't decide if the packet's source or destination address is an
IP directed broadcast address; it is supposed to ignore packets with such
addresses.
