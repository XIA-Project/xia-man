.SH "NAME"
BandwidthMeter \- Click element;
classifies packet stream by arrival rate
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBBandwidthMeter\fR(RATE1, RATE2, ..., RATE\fIn\fR)

\fBPorts\fR: 1 input, 2 or more outputs
.br
\fBProcessing\fR: push
.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Classifies packet stream based on the rate of packet arrival.  The rate
is measured in bytes per second using an exponential weighted moving
average.  (The related 
.M Meter 7
element measures rates in packets per
second.)
.PP
The configuration string consists of one or more RATE arguments.  Each
RATE is a bandwidth, such as "384 kbps".  Earlier
rates in the list must be less than later rates. A 
.M Meter 7
with \fIn\fR rate
arguments will have \fIn\fR+1 outputs. It sends packets out the output
corresponding to the current rate. If the rate is less than RATE1
packets are sent to output 0; if it is >= RATE1 but < RATE2, packets are
sent to output 1; and so on. If it is >= RATE\fIn\fR, packets are sent to
output \fIn\fR.
.PP

.SH "EXAMPLES"
This configuration fragment drops the input stream when it is generating
more than 20,000 bytes per second.
