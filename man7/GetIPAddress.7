.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Copies 4 bytes from the packet, starting at OFFSET, to the destination IP
address annotation. OFFSET is usually 16, to fetch the destination address
from an IP packet.
.PP
Set ANNO to set a non-default destination IP address annotation.
.PP
You may also give an IP keyword argument instead of an OFFSET.  IP must
equal 'src' or 'dst'.  The input packet must have its IP header annotation
set.  The named destination IP address annotation is set to that IP
header's source or destination address, respectively.
.PP

.SH "NOTES"
The destination address annotation is used by elements
that need to know where the packet is going.
Such elements include 
.M ARPQuerier 7
and LookupIPRoute.
