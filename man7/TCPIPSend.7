.IP "\fBsend\fR (write-only)" 5
Expects a string "saddr sport daddr dport seqno ackno bits [count stop]".
"saddr sport daddr dport seqno ackno" have their obvious meanings.  "bits"
is the value of the 6 TCP flags.  The optional "count" argument is the
number of packets to send.  The optional "stop" argument is a Boolean; if
true, stops the router after sending the packets.
