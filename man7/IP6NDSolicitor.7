IP6NDSolicitor \- Click element;

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBIP6NDSolicitor\fR(IP, ETH)

\fBPorts\fR: 2 inputs, 1-2 outputs

\fBProcessing\fR: push

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Handles most of the Neighbor Discovery(ND) protocol.
Argument IP should be this host's IP6 address, and ETH should
be this host's ethernet address.
.PP
Expects ordinary IP6 packets on input 0, each with a destination
address annotation. If an ethernet address is already known
for the destination, the IP6 packet is wrapped in an ethernet
header and sent to output 0. Otherwise the IP6 packet is saved and
an Neighbor Solicitation Message is sent to output 0.
If an Neighbor Advertisement Message arrives
on input 1 for an IP6 address that we need, the mapping is
recorded and the saved IP6 packet is sent.
.PP
The packets on input 1 should include the ethernet header.
.PP
If a host has multiple interfaces, it will need multiple
instances of \fBIP6NDSolicitor\fR.
.PP
\fBIP6NDSolicitor\fR may have one or two outputs. If it has two, then ARP queries
are sent to the second output.
