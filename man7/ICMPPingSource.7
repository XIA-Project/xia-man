.SH "NAME"
ICMPPingSource \- Click element;
periodically sends ICMP echo requests
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBICMPPingSource\fR(SRC, DST [, \fIkeywords\fR INTERVAL, IDENTIFIER, LIMIT, DATA, ACTIVE])

\fBPorts\fR: at most 1 input, 1 output
.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Periodically emits ping packets with source IP address SRC and destination
address DST.  Advances the "sequence" field by one each time.  (The sequence
field is stored in network byte order in the packet.)  When its output is
pull, generates a ping packet on every pull.
.PP
\fBICMPPingSource\fR's optional input accepts replies to the pings it sends.  If you
send replies to this input, \fBICMPPingSource\fR will print reply reports and keep
loss and RTT statistics like the ping(1) program.  You can access those
stistics with the "\f(CWsummary\fR" handler.
.PP
Keyword arguments are:
.PP


.IP "INTERVAL" 8
Amount of time between pings, in seconds. Defaults to 1.
.IP "" 8
.IP "IDENTIFIER" 8
Integer. Determines the ICMP identifier field in emitted pings. Defaults to
0.
.IP "" 8
.IP "LIMIT" 8
Integer. The number of pings to send; but if LIMIT is negative, sends pings
forever. Defaults to -1.
.IP "" 8
.IP "STOP" 8
Boolean. If true, stop the router when LIMIT is reached. Defaults to false.
.IP "" 8
.IP "DATA" 8
String. Extra data in emitted pings. Defaults to the empty string (nothing).
.IP "" 8
.IP "ACTIVE" 8
Boolean. Whether \fBICMPPingSource\fR is active. Defaults to true.
.IP "" 8
.IP "MIRROR" 8
Boolean. If true, then when \fBICMPPingSource\fR receives an echo reply, it
generates the next echo request immediately, using the same packet data.
Overrides LIMIT; only available if output is push. Defaults to false.
.IP "" 8
.IP "VERBOSE" 8
Boolean. Whether \fBICMPPingSource\fR should print reports when echo replies
arrive. Defaults to true.
.IP "" 8
