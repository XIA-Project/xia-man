.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Pretends to be a 
.M GridLocationInfo 7
element, but actually reads the
locations from a file. Each line of the file looks like
.PP
.nf
\& interval lat lon
.fi
.PP
This means means "spend interval seconds moving to lat/lon."
.PP
Here's a reasonable test file that keeps the node more or
less within 250 meters of 0,0:
.PP
1 0 0
10 .002 .002
20 0 .003
30 0 0
.PP
