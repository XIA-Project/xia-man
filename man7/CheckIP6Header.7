.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBCheckIP6Header\fR([BADADDRS, OFFSET])

\fBPorts\fR: 1 input, 1-2 outputs

\fBProcessing\fR: agnostic, but output 1 is push

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Expects IP6 packets as input starting at OFFSET bytes. Default OFFSET
is zero. Checks that the packet's length is
reasonable, and that the IP6 version,  length, are valid. Checks that the
IP6 source address is a legal unicast address. Shortens packets to the IP6
length, if the IP length is shorter than the nominal packet length (due to
Ethernet padding, for example). Pushes invalid packets out on output 1,
unless output 1 was unused; if so, drops invalid packets.

Keyword arguments are:
.PP


.IP "BADADDRS" 8
The BADADDRS argument is a space-separated list of IP6 addresses that are
not to be tolerated as source addresses. 0::0 is a bad address for routers,
for example, but okay for link local packets.
.IP "" 8
.IP "OFFSET" 8
Unsigned integer. Byte position at which the IP6 header begins. Default is 0.
