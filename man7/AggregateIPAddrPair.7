sets aggregate annotation based on IP source/destination address pair

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBAggregateIPAddrPair\fR sets the aggregate annotation on every passing packet to a
flow number based on its IP address pair.  Packets with the same
source-destination address pair are assigned the same aggregate number, as are
reply packets (with source and destination addresses switched).  The paint
annotation is set to 0 or 1 to indicate which direction the packet was headed.
.PP
Flow numbers are assigned sequentially, starting from 1. Different flows get
different numbers. Paint annotations are set to 0 or 1, depending on whether
packets are on the forward or reverse subflow. (The first packet seen on each
flow gets paint color 0; reply packets get paint color 1.)
.PP
Keywords are:
.PP


.IP "TIMEOUT" 8
The timeout for active address pairs, in seconds.  Default is no timeout
(address pairs never expire).  If a timeout is specified, then information
about an address pair is forgotten after that timeout passes; if the address
pair occurs again later, it will get a new aggregate annotation.
.IP "" 8
.IP "REAP" 8
The garbage collection interval. Default is 20 minutes of packet time.
.IP "" 8
.PP
\fBAggregateIPAddrPair\fR is an AggregateNotifier, so AggregateListeners can request
notifications when new aggregates are created and old ones are deleted.

.IP "\fBclear\fR (write-only)" 5
Clears all flow information.  Future packets will get new aggregate annotation
values.
