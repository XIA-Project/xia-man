.TH "HOSTETHERFILTER" 7click "12/Oct/2017" "Click"
.SH "NAME"
HostEtherFilter \- Click element;
drops Ethernet packets sent to other machines
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBHostEtherFilter\fR(ETHER [, DROP_OWN, DROP_OTHER, \fIKEYWORDS\fR])

\fBPorts\fR: 1 input, 1-2 outputs
.br
\fBProcessing\fR: agnostic, but output 1 is push
.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Expects Ethernet packets as input. Acts basically like Ethernet input hardware
for a device with address ETHER.
.PP
In particular, \fBHostEtherFilter\fR sets each packet's packet type annotation to
HOST, BROADCAST, MULTICAST, or OTHERHOST based on its Ethernet destination
address. Emits most packets on the first output. If DROP_OWN is true, drops
packets whose source address is ETHER; defaults to false. If DROP_OTHER is
true, drops packets sent to hosts other than ETHER (that is, packets with
unicast destination addresses not equal to ETHER); defaults to true. If the
element has two outputs, filtered packets are emitted on the second output
rather than dropped.
.PP
Keyword arguments are:
