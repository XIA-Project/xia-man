.SH "NAME"
BandwidthRatedSplitter \- Click element;
splits flow of packets at specified bandwidth rate
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBBandwidthRatedSplitter\fR(RATE, I[<KEYWORDS>])

\fBPorts\fR: 1 input, 1-2 outputs
.br
\fBProcessing\fR: Push
.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBBandwidthRatedSplitter\fR has two output ports.  All incoming packets up to a
maximum of RATE are emitted on output port 0.  Any remaining packets are
emitted on output port 1.  RATE is a bandwidth, such as "384 kbps".
Unlike 
.M BandwidthMeter 7 ,
the base RATE is emitted on output port
0 even when the input rate is greater than RATE.
.PP
The rate is implemented using a token bucket.  The capacity of this token
bucket defaults to 20 milliseconds worth of tokens, but can be customized by
setting one of BURST_DURATION or BURST_SIZE.
.PP
Keyword arguments are:
.PP


.IP "RATE" 8
Bandwidth.  Token bucket fill rate.
.IP "" 8
.IP "BURST_DURATION" 8
Time.  If specified, the capacity of the token bucket is calculated as
rate * burst_duration.
.IP "" 8
.IP "BURST_BYTES" 8
Integer.  If specified, the capacity of the token bucket is set to this
value in bytes.
