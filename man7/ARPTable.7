.SH "NAME"
ARPTable \- Click element;
stores IP-to-Ethernet mappings
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBARPTable\fR(\fIkeywords\fR)

\fBPorts\fR: none

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBARPTable\fR element stores IP-to-Ethernet mappings, such as are useful for
the ARP protocol.  \fBARPTable\fR is an information element, with no inputs or
outputs.  
.M ARPQuerier 7
normally encapsulates access to an \fBARPTable\fR element.  A
separate \fBARPTable\fR is useful if several 
.M ARPQuerier 7
elements should share a
table.
.PP
Keyword arguments are:
.PP


.IP "CAPACITY" 8
Unsigned integer.  The maximum number of saved IP packets the \fBARPTable\fR will
hold at a time.  Default is 2048; zero means unlimited.
.IP "" 8
.IP "ENTRY_CAPACITY" 8
Unsigned integer.  The maximum number of ARP entries the \fBARPTable\fR will hold at
a time.  Default is zero, which means unlimited.
.IP "" 8
.IP "ENTRY_PACKET_CAPACITY" 8
Unsigned integer.  The maximum number of saved IP packets the \fBARPTable\fR will hold
for any given ARP entry at a time.  Default is zero, which means unlimited.
.IP "" 8
.IP "CAPACITY_SLIM_FACTOR" 8
Unsigned integer. \fBARPTable\fR removes 1/CAPACITY_SLIM_FACTOR of saved packets on
exceeding CAPACITY. Default is 2.  Increase for better bounds on the number of
saved packets; decrease for better performance under an nmap-style denial-of-
service attack.
.IP "" 8
.IP "TIMEOUT" 8
Time value.  The amount of time after which an ARP entry will expire.  Default
is 5 minutes.  Zero means ARP entries never expire.
.IP "" 8

.SH "ELEMENT HANDLERS"



.IP "\fBtable\fR (read-only)" 5
Return a table of the ARP entries.  The returned string has four
space-separated columns: an IP address, whether the entry is valid (1 means
valid, 0 means not), the corresponding Ethernet address, and finally, the
amount of time since the entry was last updated.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBdrops\fR (read-only)" 5
Return the number of packets dropped because of timeouts or capacity limits.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBinsert\fR (write-only)" 5
Add an entry to the table.  The format should be "IP ETH".
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBdelete\fR (write-only)" 5
Delete an entry from the table.  The string should consist of an IP address.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBclear\fR (write-only)" 5
Clear the table, deleting all entries.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBcount\fR (read-only)" 5
Return the number of entries in the table.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBlength\fR (read-only)" 5
Return the number of packets stored in the table.
.IP "" 5
