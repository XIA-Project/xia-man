ETH and IP are this nodes's ethernet and IP addresses, respectively.
The 3rd, 4th, and 5th arguments are the configuration's local and
geographic forwarding elements.  They are required so that the
probe replies can contain information about the routing actions
taken for this packet.

out of its second output, and pushes the probe out of the first
output (if the probe should be forwarded).
