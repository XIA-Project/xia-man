.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Set the checksum and some other fields to try to make a packet look like
TCP. If DPORT is specified and not 0, forces the destination port to be
DPORT. Otherwise, if RANDOM_DPORT is set, destination port may be randomly set.
If RANDOM_DPORT is not set and DPORT is 0, destination port is untouched. RANDOM_DPORT
has no effect if DPORT is not 0. If FLAGS is specified and not -1, set the
TCP flags field to FLAGS.
