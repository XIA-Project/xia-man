.SH "NAME"
ToHostSniffers \- Click element;
sends packets to Linux packet sniffers
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBToHostSniffers\fR([DEVNAME, \fIkeywords\fR])

\fBPorts\fR: 1 input, no outputs
.br
\fBProcessing\fR: push
.br
\fBDrivers\fR: linuxmodule

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Hands packets to any packet sniffers registered with Linux, such as packet
sockets. Packets are not passed to the ordinary Linux networking stack.
.PP
If DEVNAME is present, each packet is marked to appear as if it originated
from that network device. As with 
.M ToDevice 7 ,
DEVNAME can be an Ethernet
address.
.PP
If TYPE is ETHER, then expects packets with Ethernet headers; this is the
default.  If TYPE is IP, then expects packets with raw IP headers.
.PP
This element is only available in the Linux kernel module.
.PP

.SH "NOTES"
\fBToHostSniffers\fR behaves exactly like 
.M ToHost 7 ,
except that the SNIFFERS
keyword argument defaults to true.
