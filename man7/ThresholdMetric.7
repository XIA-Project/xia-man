.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Child class of GridGenericMetric that implements the delivery ratio
threshold metric.  Links with a delivery ratio larger than a given
threshold (specified by the THRESH keyword argument) are considered
good; links with a smaller delivery ratio are considered bad.  The
metric of a route with all good links is the route's hopcount; a
route with at least one bad link is given the special `bad' invalid
metric.  Between two good routes with valid metrics, the route with
the smaller hopcount is preferred; between two bad routes with
invalid metrics, neither route is preferred and an arbitrary choice
is made; between a good and bad route, the good route is always
preferred.

.M LinkStat 7
is this node's 
.M LinkStat 7
element, which is needed to obtain
the link delivery ratios used to calculate the metric.

Keywords arguments are:

.IP "TWOWAY" 8
Boolean.  If true, both directions of a link must have a delivery
ratio greater than the threshold for the link to be good.  If
false, only require the forward direction to have a delivery ratio
greater than the threshold.  Defaults to false.
.IP "" 8
.IP "THRESH" 8
Unsigned.  Delivery ratio threshold as a percentage (0--100).
Defaults to 63%, which is roughly 5/8, the threshold used in the
DARPA PRNet.
