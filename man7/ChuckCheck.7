.IP "\fBinfo\fR (read-only)" 5
Returns a binary string represented the information collected on the last 4096
packets received. (If less than 4096 packets have been received, returns as
much information as it has.)
.IP "" 5
The string consists of a number of 4-byte unsigned integers in host byte
order. The first integer is N, the number of records in the rest of the
string. After this comes N information records. Each record looks like this:
.IP "" 5
.nf
\&    0              4              8              12
\&  +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+
\&  |  packet ID   |timestamp sec |timestamp usec| source addr  |
\&  +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+
.fi
.IP "" 5
The fields are:
.IP "" 5

.RS 5

.IP "\f(CWpacket ID\fR" 5
The identification number of this packet. The first packet \fBChuckCheck\fR receives
gets ID number 0, and packets are sequentially numbered after that. The reader
can use packet ID numbers to differentiate new information from information it
has already processed.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\f(CWtimestamp sec\fR, \f(CWtimestamp usec\fR" 5
The time when the packet arrived at the \fBChuckCheck\fR element.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\f(CWsource addr\fR" 5
The packet's IP source address.
.IP "" 5
.RE
.IP "" 5
The records are returned in increasing, sequential order by packet ID.
