duplicates packets like a hub
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBHub\fR()

\fBPorts\fR: any number of inputs, the same number of outputs

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBHub\fR sends a copy of each input packet out each output port.  However, a packet
received on input port N is not emitted on output port N.  Thus, the element
acts sort of like an Ethernet hub (but it is not Ethernet specific).
