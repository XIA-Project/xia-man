.SH "NAME"
FromDAGDump \- Click element;
reads packets from a DAG/ERF file
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBFromDAGDump\fR(FILENAME [, \fIKEYWORDS\fR])

\fBPorts\fR: no inputs, 1-2 outputs
.br
\fBProcessing\fR: agnostic, but output 1 is push
.br
\fBDrivers\fR: userlevel
.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Reads packets from a file in ERF format, produced by the University of
Waikato's DAG tools. Pushes them out the output, and optionally stops the
driver when there are no more packets.
.PP
\fBFromDAGDump\fR also transparently reads gzip- and bzip2-compressed files, if you
have zcat(1) and bzcat(1) installed.
.PP
Keyword arguments are:
.PP


.IP "STOP" 8
Boolean.  If true, then \fBFromDAGDump\fR will ask the router to stop when it is
done reading its file (or the END time is reached).  Default is false.
.IP "" 8
.IP "ACTIVE" 8
Boolean. If false, then \fBFromDAGDump\fR will not emit packets (until the
`\f(CWactive\fR' handler is written). Default is true.
.IP "" 8
.IP "FORCE_IP" 8
Boolean. If true, then \fBFromDAGDump\fR will emit only IP packets with their IP
header annotations correctly set. (If \fBFromDAGDump\fR has two outputs, non-IP
packets are pushed out on output 1; otherwise, they are dropped.) Default is
false.
.IP "" 8
.IP "START" 8
Absolute time in seconds since the epoch. \fBFromDAGDump\fR will output packets with
timestamps after that time.
.IP "" 8
.IP "START_AFTER" 8
Argument is relative time in seconds (or supply a suffix like `min', `h').
\fBFromDAGDump\fR will skip the first \fIT\fR seconds in the log.
.IP "" 8
.IP "END" 8
Absolute time in seconds since the epoch. \fBFromDAGDump\fR will stop when
encountering a packet with timestamp at or after that time.
.IP "" 8
.IP "END_AFTER" 8
Argument is relative time in seconds (or supply a suffix like `min', `h').
\fBFromDAGDump\fR will stop at the first packet whose timestamp is at least \fIT\fR
seconds after the first timestamp in the log.
.IP "" 8
.IP "INTERVAL" 8
Argument is relative time in seconds (or supply a suffix like `min', `h').
\fBFromDAGDump\fR will stop at the first packet whose timestamp is at least \fIT\fR
seconds after the first packet output.
.IP "" 8
.IP "END_CALL" 8
Specify a handler to call once the end time is reached, or the dump runs out
of packets.  This defaults to '\fIFromDAGDump\fR.active false'.  END_CALL and
STOP are mutually exclusive.
.IP "" 8
.IP "SAMPLE" 8
Unsigned real number between 0 and 1. \fBFromDAGDump\fR will output each packet with
probability SAMPLE. Default is 1. \fBFromDAGDump\fR uses fixed-point arithmetic, so
the actual sampling probability may differ substantially from the requested
sampling probability. Use the \f(CWsampling_prob\fR handler to find out the actual
probability.
.IP "" 8
.IP "TIMING" 8
Boolean. If true, then \fBFromDAGDump\fR tries to maintain the inter-packet timing
of the original packet stream. False by default.
.IP "" 8
.IP "ENCAP" 8
Legacy encapsulation type ("IP", "ATM", "SUNATM", "ETHER", "PPP", or
"PPP_HDLC").  New-style ERF dumps contain an explicit encapsulation type on
each packet; you should not provide an ENCAP option for new-style ERF dumps.
Legacy-format dumps don't contain any encapsulation information, however, so
you should supply an encapsulation type explicitly (or \fBFromDAGDump\fR will assume
ENCAP type "ATM").
.IP "" 8
.IP "MMAP" 8
Boolean. If true, then \fBFromDAGDump\fR will use 
.M mmap 2
to access the tcpdump
file. This can result in slightly better performance on some machines.
\fBFromDAGDump\fR's regular file discipline is pretty optimized, so the difference
is often small in practice. Default is true on most operating systems, but
false on Linux.
.IP "" 8
.PP
You can supply at most one of START and START_AFTER, and at most one of END,
END_AFTER, and INTERVAL.
.PP
Only available in user-level processes.
.PP
.SH "NOTES"
\fBFromDAGDump\fR sets packets' extra length annotations to any additional length
recorded in the dump.

.SH "ELEMENT HANDLERS"



.IP "\fBsampling_prob\fR (read-only)" 5
Returns the sampling probability (see the SAMPLE keyword argument).
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBactive\fR (read/write)" 5
Value is a Boolean.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBencap\fR (read-only)" 5
Returns the previous packet's encapsulation type.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBfilename\fR (read-only)" 5
Returns the filename supplied to \fBFromDAGDump\fR.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBfilesize\fR (read-only)" 5
Returns the length of the \fBFromDAGDump\fR file, in bytes, or "-" if that length
cannot be determined (because the file was compressed, for example).
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBfilepos\fR (read-only)" 5
Returns \fBFromDAGDump\fR's position in the (uncompressed) file, in bytes.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBextend_interval\fR (write-only)" 5
Text is a time interval. If END_TIME or one of its cousins was specified, then
writing to this handler extends END_TIME by that many seconds. Also, ACTIVE is
set to true.
