.SH "NAME"
RandomSample \- Click element;
samples packets with some probability
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBRandomSample\fR([P, \fIKEYWORDS\fR])

\fBPorts\fR: 1 input, 1-2 outputs
.br
\fBProcessing\fR: agnostic, but output 1 is push
.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Samples packets with probability P. One out of 1/P packets are sent to the
first output. The remaining packets are dropped, unless the element has two
outputs, in which case they are emitted on output 1.
.PP
If you don't specify P, you must supply one of the SAMPLE and DROP keyword
arguments.
.PP
Keyword arguments are:
.PP


.IP "SAMPLE \fIP\fR" 8
Sets the sampling probability to \fIP\fR.
.IP "" 8
.IP "DROP \fIQ\fR" 8
The element will drop packets with probability \fIQ\fR. Same as suppling (1 -
\fIQ\fR) as the sampling probability.
.IP "" 8
.IP "ACTIVE" 8
Boolean. \fBRandomSample\fR is active or inactive; when inactive, it sends all
packets to output 0. Default is true (active).
.IP "" 8
.PP
