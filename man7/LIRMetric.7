.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Child class of GridGenericMetric that implements the `Least
Interference Routing' metric.  The metric is the sum of the number
1-hop neighbors of each node in the route.  This node's number of
1-hop neighbors is obtained from the GridGenericRouteTable
argument.  Smaller metric values are better.

LIR is described in `Spatial Reuse Through Dynamic Power and
Routing Control in Common-Channel Random-Access Packet Radio
Networks', James Almon Stevens, Ph.D. Thesis, University of Texas
at Dallas, 1988.
