Expects Grid MAC layer packets on input 0.  Any packet transmitted
by a Grid node within RANGE metres from this node is sent to output
0.  Packets transmitted by ``out of range'' nodes are sent out
output 1.  RANGE is an Integer.  A negative range means no packets
are filtered out.  This element is useful for simulating physical
topologies.  This element uses the
