.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Transports packets to and from a User Mode Linux switch daemon
instance. Packets do not flow through \fBUMLSwitch\fR elements (i.e.,
\fBUMLSwitch\fR is an "x/y" element). Instead, input packets are sent to the
UML switch, and packets received from the UML switch are emitted on
the output.

If FILENAME is not specified, "/tmp/uml.ctl" will be used as the path
