.SH "NAME"
TimeFilter \- Click element;
filter packets by timestamp
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBTimeFilter\fR(\fIkeywords START, START_AFTER, START_DELAY, END, END_AFTER, END_DELAY, INTERVAL, STOP, END_CALL\fR)

\fBPorts\fR: 1 input, 1-2 outputs
.br
\fBProcessing\fR: agnostic, but output 1 is push
.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBTimeFilter\fR passes packets through only if they lie within a timestamp range.
You can specify that range absolutely or relative to the first timestamp
\fBTimeFilter\fR sees.
.PP
Keyword arguments are:
.PP


.IP "START" 8
\fIT\fR is absolute time in seconds since the epoch. Output packets with
timestamps at least \fIT\fR.
.IP "" 8
.IP "START_AFTER" 8
\fIT\fR is relative time in seconds (or use suffixes like `ms', `hr'). Output
packets with timestamps at least \fIT\fR seconds after the first packet seen.
.IP "" 8
.IP "START_DELAY" 8
\fIT\fR is relative time. Output packets with timestamps at least \fIT\fR seconds
after initialize time.
.IP "" 8
.IP "END" 8
\fIT\fR is absolute time. Output packets with timestamps up to \fIT\fR.
.IP "" 8
.IP "END_AFTER" 8
\fIT\fR is relative time. Output packets with timestamps up to \fIT\fR seconds after
the first packet seen.
.IP "" 8
.IP "END_DELAY" 8
\fIT\fR is relative time. Output packets with timestamps up to \fIT\fR seconds after
initialize time.
.IP "" 8
.IP "INTERVAL" 8
\fIT\fR is relative time. Output packets for \fIT\fR seconds after the start time,
as specified by START or START_AFTER.
.IP "" 8
.IP "STOP" 8
Boolean. If true, stop the driver once the end time is exceeded. Default is
false.
.IP "" 8
.IP "END_CALL" 8
Specifies a write handler to call when the first packet after END is seen.
The variable "$t" in the write handler argument is expanded to the packet's
timestamp.  STOP and END_CALL are mutually exclusive.
.IP "" 8
.PP
Supply at most one of START, START_AFTER, and START_DELAY, and at most one of
END, END_AFTER, END_DELAY, and INTERVAL.
.PP
.SH "ELEMENT HANDLERS"



.IP "\fBstart\fR (read/write)" 5
Returns or sets the START time.  If you used START_AFTER or START_DELAY, then
this handler returns garbage until a packet has passed.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBend\fR (read/write)" 5
Returns or sets the END time.  If you used START_AFTER or START_DELAY, then
this handler returns garbage until a packet has passed.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBinterval\fR (read/write)" 5
Returns or sets the INTERVAL.  Setting INTERVAL leaves the current START as is
and adjusts END.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBextend_interval\fR (write-only)" 5
Takes a timestamp.  Extends the LAST time by that amount.  If extend_interval
is called from an END_CALL handler, then the triggering packet is not dropped.
