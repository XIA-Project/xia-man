.SH "NAME"
CheckARPHeader \- Click element;
checks ARP header
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBCheckARPHeader\fR([OFFSET, \fIkeywords\fR OFFSET, VERBOSE, DETAILS])

\fBPorts\fR: 1 input, 1-2 outputs
.br
\fBProcessing\fR: agnostic, but output 1 is push
.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Input packets should have ARP headers starting OFFSET bytes in. Default OFFSET
is zero. Checks that the packet's length is reasonable.
.PP
\fBCheckARPHeader\fR emits valid packets on output 0. Invalid packets are pushed out
on output 1, unless output 1 was unused; if so, drops invalid packets.
.PP
\fBCheckARPHeader\fR prints a message to the console the first time it encounters an
incorrect ARP packet (but see VERBOSE below).
.PP
Keyword arguments are:
.PP


.IP "OFFSET" 5
Unsigned integer. Byte position at which the ARP header begins. Default is 0.
.IP "" 5
.IP "VERBOSE" 5
Boolean. If it is true, then a message will be printed for every erroneous
packet, rather than just the first. False by default.
.IP "" 5
.IP "DETAILS" 5
Boolean. If it is true, then \fBCheckARPHeader\fR will maintain detailed counts of
how many packets were dropped for each possible reason, accessible through the
\f(CWdrop_details\fR handler. False by default.
.IP "" 5
