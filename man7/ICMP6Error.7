.SH "NAME"
ICMP6Error \- Click element;

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBICMP6Error\fR(IP6ADDR, TYPE, CODE)

\fBPorts\fR: 1 input, 1 output
.br
\fBProcessing\fR: agnostic
.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
need to rewrite the following comments.
Generate an ICMP6 error or redirect packet, with specified TYPE and CODE,
in response to an incoming IP6 packet. The output is an IP6/ICMP6 packet.
The ICMP6 packet's IP6 source address is set to IP6ADDR.
The error packet will include (as payload)
the original packet's IP6 header and the first 8 byte of the packet's
IP6 payload. \fBICMP6Error\fR sets the packet destination IP6 and
fix_ip_src annotations.
.PP
The intent is that elements that give rise to errors, like 
.M DecIP6HLIM 7 ,
should have two outputs, one of which is connected to an \fBICMP6Error\fR.
Perhaps the \fBICMP6Error\fR()s should be followed by a rate limiting
element.
.PP
\fBICMP6Error\fR never generates a packet in response to an ICMP6 error packet,
a fragment, or a link broadcast.
.PP
The output of ICMPE6rror should be connected to the routing lookup
machinery, much as if the ICMP6 errors came from a hardware interface.
.PP

.SH "EXAMPLES"
This configuration fragment produces ICMP6 Time Exceeded error
messages in response to HLIM expirations, but limits the
rate at which such messages can be sent to 10 per second:
.PP
.nf
\& dt : DecIP6HLIM();
\& dt[1] -> ICMP6Error(18.26.4.24, 3, 0) -> m :: RatedSplitter(10) -> ...
\& m[1] -> Discard;
.fi
.PP



.SH "NOTES"
\fBICMP6Error\fR can't decide if the packet's source or destination address is an
IP6 directed broadcast address; it is supposed to ignore packets with such
addresses.
.PP

.SH "SEE ALSO"
.M DecIP6HLIM 7
