.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBXARPTable\fR element stores IP-to-Ethernet mappings, such as are useful for
the XARP protocol.  \fBXARPTable\fR is an information element, with no inputs or
outputs.  
.M XARPQuerier 7
normally encapsulates access to an \fBXARPTable\fR element.  A
separate \fBXARPTable\fR is useful if several 
.M XARPQuerier 7
elements should share a
table.
.PP
Keyword arguments are:
.PP


.IP "CAPACITY" 8
Unsigned integer.  The maximum number of saved IP packets the \fBXARPTable\fR will
hold at a time.  Default is 2048; zero means unlimited.
.IP "" 8
.IP "ENTRY_CAPACITY" 8
Unsigned integer.  The maximum number of XARP entries the \fBXARPTable\fR will hold at
a time.  Default is zero, which means unlimited.
