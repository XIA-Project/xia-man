.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This element implements the GridGenericLocInfo interface.  Unlike
.M GridLocationInfo 7 ,
this element can work in the kernel.
.PP
LATITUDE and LONGITUDE are in milliseconds.  Positive is North and
East, negative is South and West.  HEIGHT is in millimetres,
positive is up.  All are integers.
.PP
Keyword arguments are:
.PP


.IP "LOC_GOOD" 8
Boolean.  If true, it means the location information (including
error radius) can be believed.  If false, don't believe the hype,
it's a sequel, i.e. it's all bogus.
.IP "" 8
.IP "ERR_RADIUS" 8
Unsigned short.  The error radius in metres.  The node's actual
location is within a circle of ERR_RADIUS metres, centered at the
supplied location.
.IP "" 8
.IP "TAG" 8
String.  A symbolic name used to identify this node's location,
e.g. "ne43-521b", or "Robert's office".

.IP "\fBloc\fR (read/write)" 5
When reading, returns the element's location information, in this
format: ``lat, lon, height (err=<err-radius> good=<good?> seq=<seq>)''.
.IP "" 5
.nf
\& <err-radius> is in metres, <good?> is "yes" or "no", indicating
\& whether the location information is at all valid (i.e. don't
\& believe any of it unless <good?> is "yes"), and <seq> is the
\& location sequence number; it changes every time the location or
\& other parameters change.

.IP "" 5
When writing, use the same syntax as the configuration arguments.
