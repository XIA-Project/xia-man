\fBThreadSafeQueue\fR(CAPACITY)

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Stores incoming packets in a first-in-first-out queue.
Drops incoming packets if the queue already holds CAPACITY packets.
The default for CAPACITY is 1000.
.PP
This variant of the default 
.M Queue 7
is (should be) completely thread safe, in
that it supports multiple concurrent pushers and pullers.  In all respects
other than thread safety it behaves just like 
.M Queue 7 ,
and like 
.M Queue 7
it has
non-full and non-empty notifiers.
