CoDel \- Click element;
drops packets according to CoDel
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBCoDel\fR([, \fIKEYWORDS\fR])

\fBProcessing\fR: pull

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Implements \fBCoDel\fR (Controlled Delay) active queue management
mechanism.
.PP
A \fBCoDel\fR element is associated with one or more Storage elements (usually
Queues). It tracks the sojourn time of every packet in the queue, and
increases the frequency of dropping packets until the queue is controlled,
i.e. the sojourn time goes below the threshold. The sojourn time is tracked
based on the "first timestamp" annotation, which must be set using the
.M SetTimestamp 7
element just before the packet is enqueued. Later, \fBCoDel\fR overwrites
this annotation with the sojourn time experienced by the corresponding
packet for (possible) statistical use thereafter.
.PP
By default, the Queues are found with flow-based router context and only the
upstream queues are searched. \fBCoDel\fR is a pull element.
.PP
Arguments are:
.PP


.IP "TARGET" 8
Integer. Target sojourn time of the packet in the queue, default value is 5 ms.
.IP "" 8
.IP "INTERVAL" 8
Integer. Sliding minimum window width, the default value is 100 ms.
.IP "" 8
.IP "QUEUES" 8
This argument is a space-separated list of Storage element names. \fBCoDel\fR will use
those elements' queue lengths, rather than any elements found via flow-based
router context.
.IP "" 8
