.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBFastUDPSourceIP6\fR is a benchmark tool. At initialization
time, \fBFastUDPSourceIP6\fR creates a UDP/IP6 packet of length
LENGTH (min 60), with source ethernet address SRCETH,
source IP6 address SRCIP6, source port SPORT,
destination ethernet address DSTETH, destination IP6
address DSTIP6, and destination port DPORT. The UDP
checksum is calculated if CHECKSUM is true; it is
true by default. Each time the FastUDPSource element
is called, it increments the reference count on the
skbuff created and returns the skbuff object w/o
copying or cloning. Therefore, the packet returned by
FastUDPSource should not be modified.
.PP
FastUDPSource sents packets at RATE packets per
second. It will send LIMIT number of packets in
total.
.PP
After FastUDPSource has sent LIMIT packets, it will
calculate the average send rate (packets per second)
between the first and last packets sent and make that
available in the rate handler.
.PP
By default FastUDPSource is ACTIVE.
.PP
INTERVAL is zero by default. If it is not 0, after
INTERVAL number of packets, both sport and dport will
be incremented by 1. Checksum will be recomputed.
