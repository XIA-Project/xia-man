.TH "ARPQUERIER" 7click "12/Oct/2017" "Click"
.SH "NAME"
ARPQuerier \- Click element;
encapsulates IP packets in Ethernet headers found via ARP
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBARPQuerier\fR(IP, ETH, \fIkeywords\fR)
.br
\fBARPQuerier\fR(NAME, \fIkeywords\fR)

\fBPorts\fR: 2 inputs, 1-2 outputs
.br
\fBProcessing\fR: push
.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Handles most of the ARP protocol. Argument IP should be
this host's IP address, and ETH should be this host's
Ethernet address. (In
the one-argument form, NAME should be shorthand for
both an IP and an Ethernet address; see 
.M AddressInfo 7 (n).)
.PP
Packets arriving on input 0 should be IP packets, and must have their
destination address annotations set.
If an Ethernet address is already known
for the destination, the IP packet is wrapped in an Ethernet
header and sent to output 0. Otherwise the IP packet is saved and
an ARP query is sent instead. If an ARP response arrives
on input 1 for an IP address that we need, the mapping is
recorded and any saved IP packets are sent.
.PP
The ARP reply packets on input 1 should include the Ethernet header.
.PP
\fBARPQuerier\fR may have one or two outputs. If it has two, then ARP queries
are sent to the second output.
.PP
\fBARPQuerier\fR implements special behavior for 0.0.0.0, 255.255.255.255, multicast
addresses, and, if specified, any BROADCAST address.  Packets addressed to
0.0.0.0 are dropped.  Packets for broadcast addresses are forwarded with
destination Ethernet address FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF.  Multicast IP addresses are
forwarded to 01-00-5E-xx-yy-zz, where xx-yy-zz are the lower 23 bits of the
multicast IP address, as specified in RFC1112.
.PP
Keyword arguments are:
.PP


.IP "TABLE" 8
Element.  Names an 
.M ARPTable 7
element that holds this element's corresponding
ARP state.  By default \fBARPQuerier\fR creates its own internal 
.M ARPTable 7
and uses
that.  If TABLE is specified, CAPACITY, ENTRY_CAPACITY, ENTRY_PACKET_CAPACITY,
and TIMEOUT are ignored.
.IP "" 8
.IP "CAPACITY" 8
Unsigned integer.  The maximum number of saved IP packets the table will
hold at a time.  Default is 2048.
.IP "" 8
.IP "ENTRY_CAPACITY" 8
Unsigned integer.  The maximum number of ARP entries the table will hold
at a time.  Default is 0, which means unlimited.
.IP "" 8
.IP "ENTRY_PACKET_CAPACITY" 8
Unsigned integer.  The maximum number of saved packets the table will hold
for any given ARP entry at a time.  Default is 0, which means unlimited.
.IP "" 8
.IP "TIMEOUT" 8
Amount of time before an ARP entry expires.  Defaults to 5 minutes.
.IP "" 8
.IP "POLL_TIMEOUT" 8
Amount of time after which \fBARPQuerier\fR will start polling for renewal.  0 means
don't poll.  Defaults to one minute.
.IP "" 8
.IP "BROADCAST" 8
IP address.  Local broadcast IP address.  Packets sent to this address will be
forwarded to Ethernet address FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF.  Defaults to the local
broadcast address that can be extracted from the IP address's corresponding
prefix, if any.
.IP "" 8
.IP "BROADCAST_POLL" 8
Boolean.  If true, then send broadcast ARP polls (where an entry is about to
expire, but hasn't expired yet).  The default is to send such polls unicast to
the known Ethernet address.  Defaults to false.
.IP "" 8

.SH "NOTES"
If a host has multiple interfaces, it will need multiple
instances of \fBARPQuerier\fR.
.PP
\fBARPQuerier\fR uses packets' destination IP address annotations, and can destroy
their next packet annotations.  Generated ARP queries have VLAN TCI
annotations set from the corresponding input packets.
.PP
\fBARPQuerier\fR will send at most 10 queries a second for any IP address.
