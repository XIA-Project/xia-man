.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Implements a DSDV-like loop-free routing protocol by originating
routing messages based on its routing and neighbor tables, and
processing routing update messages from other nodes.  Maintains an
immediate neighbor table, and a multi-hop route table.  For both
tables, entries are removed TIMEOUT milliseconds after being
installed.
.PP
Routing message entries are marked with both a sequence number
(originated by the destination of the entry) and an age.  Entries
with higher sequence numbers always supersede entries with lower
sequence numbers.  For entries with the same sequence number, the lower
hop-count entry prevails.  Entries increase in age while sitting in
a node's routing table, as well as when being propagated to another
node.  Thus an individual entry will only propagate through the
network for a finite amount of time.
.PP
New routes are advertised with even sequence numbers originated by
the route destination (obtained from LR_HELLO messages); broken
routes are advertised with odd sequence numbers formed by adding 1
to the sequence number of the last known good route.  Broken route
advertisements are originally initiated when an immediate neighbor
entry times out, and will always supersede the route they are
concerned with; any new route will always supersede the previous
broken route.  When a node receives a broken route advertisement
for a destination to which it knows a newer route, it kills the
broken route advertisement and sends an advertisement for the the
new route.
.PP
Input 0 expects MAC layer Grid packets which are handled as
necessary and sent to output 0.
.PP
Output 1: every PERIOD milliseconds (+/- a jitter bounded by JITTER
milliseconds), emits a Grid protocol ``LR_HELLO'' packet for the
Grid node at address IP with MAC address ETH, advertising any
neighbors within MAXHOPS of the node.  MAXHOPS defaults to 3.
PERIOD must be greater than 0, JITTER must be positive and less
than JITTER.  Produces MAC layer Grid packets.
