.SH "NAME"
RadixIPsecLookup \- Click element;
IP lookup using a radix trie
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBRadixIPsecLookup\fR(ADDR1/MASK1 [GW1] OUT1, ADDR2/MASK2 [GW2] OUT2, ...)

\fBPorts\fR: 1 input, any number of outputs
.br
\fBProcessing\fR: push
.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Performs IP lookup using a radix trie.  The first level of the trie has 256
buckets; each succeeding level has 16.  The maximum number of levels that will
be traversed is thus 7.
.PP
Expects a destination IP address annotation with each packet. Looks up that
address in its routing table, using longest-prefix-match, sets the destination
annotation to the corresponding GW (if specified), and emits the packet on the
indicated OUTput port.
.PP
Each argument is a route, specifying a destination and mask, an optional
gateway IP address, and an output port.
.PP
Uses the 
.M IPsecRouteTable 7
interface; see 
.M IPsecRouteTable 7
for description.

.SH "ELEMENT HANDLERS"



.IP "\fBtable\fR (read-only)" 5
Outputs a human-readable version of the current routing table.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBlookup\fR (read-only)" 5
Reports the OUTput port and GW corresponding to an address.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBadd\fR (write-only)" 5
Adds a route to the table. Format should be `\f(CWADDR/MASK [GW] OUT\fR'. Should
fail if a route for \f(CWADDR/MASK\fR already exists, but currently does not.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBset\fR (write-only)" 5
Sets a route, whether or not a route for the same prefix already exists.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBremove\fR (write-only)" 5
Removes a route from the table. Format should be `\f(CWADDR/MASK\fR'.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBctrl\fR (write-only)" 5
Adds or removes a group of routes. Write `\f(CWadd\fR/\f(CWset ADDR/MASK [GW] OUT\fR' to
add a route, and `\f(CWremove ADDR/MASK\fR' to remove a route. You can supply
multiple commands, one per line; all commands are executed as one atomic
operation.
