.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Expects an IP packet as input. If its Fix IP Source annotation is set, then
changes its IP source address field to IPADDR and recomputes the checksum.
Used by elements such as 
.M ICMPError 7
that are required by standards to use
the IP address on the outgoing interface as the source. Such elements must
set ip_src to something reasonable in case the outgoing interface has no IP
address.
