.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This element allows you to add trace entries to an ns2 trace file. The event
id is used to set "r" (receive), "f" (forward), "D" (drop), "s" (send) or
any other id. The timestamp is set to the current time. The packet length
that is traced is obtained from packet->length(). Additional info is added
behind the entry. This is not ns2 default behaviour, but since the packets
are traced as raw at the ns2 level, \fBToSimTrace\fR traces the packets as raw
as well, but to distinguish you can add the packet type in additional info or
use a
