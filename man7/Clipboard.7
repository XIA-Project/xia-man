.SH "NAME"
Clipboard \- Click element;
copies data from one packet to another
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBClipboard\fR(RANGE_1, ..., RANGE_N)

\fBPorts\fR: 2 inputs, 2 outputs
.br
\fBProcessing\fR: agnostic
.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Takes as arguments one or more byte ranges to copy. When \fBClipboard\fR receives a
packet on input 0, it copies the selected bytes to the clipboard buffer and
emits the packet unchanged on output 0. When receiving a packet on input 1,
\fBClipboard\fR updates the packet with the bytes from the buffer and outputs the
modified packet on output 1. This way, data from a single packet can be copied
to 0 or more packets.
.PP
Each RANGE is on the form \f(CWx/n\fR, where \f(CWx\fR is the offset and \f(CWn\fR the number
of bytes.
.PP
Each \fBClipboard\fR input/output pair can work in either a push or a pull context.
.PP
\fBClipboard\fR can also be used to copy data from one place in a packet to another,
by looping the same packet back through \fBClipboard\fR and using 
.M Strip 7
and 
.M Unstrip 7
to offset the packet data.
.PP
Passing a packet through input/output 1 before any packets have passed through
input/output 0 will cause undefined data to be written into the packet. Passing
a packet through input/output 1 which is too small for any one of the ranges
will cause the packet contents to be undefined.
