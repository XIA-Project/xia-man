.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Expects IP packets as input.  Should be placed downstream of a
.M CheckIPHeader 7
or equivalent element.
.PP
Prints out IP packets in a human-readable tcpdump-like format, preceded by
the LABEL text.
.PP
Keyword arguments are:
.PP


.IP "CONTENTS" 8
Determines whether the packet data is printed. It may be `NONE' (do not print
packet data), `HEX' (print packet data in hexadecimal), or `ASCII' (print
packet data in plaintext). Default is `NONE'.
.IP "" 8
.IP "PAYLOAD" 8
Like CONTENTS, but prints only the packet payload, rather than the entire
packet. Specify at most one of CONTENTS and PAYLOAD.
.IP "" 8
.IP "MAXLENGTH" 8
If CONTENTS or PAYLOAD printing is on, then MAXLENGTH determines the maximum
number of bytes to print. -1 means print the entire packet or payload. Default
is 1500.
.IP "" 8
.IP "ID" 8
Boolean. Determines whether to print each packet's IP ID field. Default is
false.
.IP "" 8
.IP "TTL" 8
Boolean. Determines whether to print each packet's IP TOS field. Default is
false.
.IP "" 8
.IP "TOS" 8
Boolean. Determines whether to print each packet's IP TOS field. Default is
false.
.IP "" 8
.IP "LENGTH" 8
Boolean. Determines whether to print each packet's IP length field. Default is
false.
.IP "" 8
.IP "TIMESTAMP" 8
Boolean. Determines whether to print each packet's timestamp in seconds since
1970. Default is true.
.IP "" 8
.IP "AGGREGATE" 8
Boolean. Determines whether to print each packet's aggregate annotation.
Default is false.
.IP "" 8
.IP "PAINT" 8
Boolean. Determines whether to print each packet's paint annotation. Default is false.
.IP "" 8
.IP "SWAP" 8
Boolean. Determines whether to print ICMP sequence and ID numbers in
network order. Default is true. The RFC does not require these
two-byte values to be sent in any particular byte order. When Click
was originally designed, Linux/i386 wrote ping sequence numbers in
host byte order (often little endian), but it uses network order now.
.IP "" 8
.IP "OUTFILE" 8
String. Only available at user level. Print information to the file specified
by OUTFILE instead of standard error.
.IP "" 8
.IP "ACTIVE" 8
Boolean.  If false, then don't print messages.  Default is true.
.IP "" 8
