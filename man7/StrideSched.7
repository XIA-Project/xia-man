.SH "NAME"
StrideSched \- Click element;
pulls from stride-scheduled inputs
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBStrideSched\fR(TICKETS0, ..., TICKETS\fIN-1\fR)

\fBPorts\fR: 1 or more inputs, 1 output
.br
\fBProcessing\fR: pull
.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Has one output and N inputs.  Performs simple packet-based stride
scheduling, assigning TICKETS\fIi\fR to input \fIi\fR for each input.
.PP
Each time a pull comes in on the output, it pulls on its inputs in the order
specified by the stride scheduling queue, until all inputs have been tried
or one produces a packet.  If an input does not produce a packet, it is not
tried again in the current round (for the current pull on the output) even
if it has a very short stride.  This minimizes overhead and ensures that
an input that produces a packet, if any, is found as soon as possible,
consistently with the stride scheduler ordering.
.PP
The inputs usually come from Queues or other pull schedulers.
\fBStrideSched\fR uses notification to avoid pulling from empty inputs.
