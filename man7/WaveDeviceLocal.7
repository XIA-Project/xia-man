.SH "NAME"
WaveDeviceLocal \- Click element;
Provides a device interface to the WAVE device driver
(WSMP protocol portion), for both sending and receiving packets.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBWaveDeviceLocal\fR()

\fBPorts\fR: any number of inputs, at most 1 output
.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If an input port is specified (either push or pull), incoming packets get
passed to the WAVE device driver. Packets arriving on the input port are
expected to start with an ethernet header, which is used to set the source
and destination MAC addresses on the WSM request.
.PP
If an output port is specified (always of the push variety), packets that
arrive at the WAVE device from the air interface are pushed through it.
