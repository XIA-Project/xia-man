.SH "NAME"
SimpleQueue \- Click element;
stores packets in a FIFO queue
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
SimpleQueue
.br
\fBSimpleQueue\fR(CAPACITY)

\fBPorts\fR: 1 input, 1-2 outputs
.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Stores incoming packets in a first-in-first-out queue.
Drops incoming packets if the queue already holds CAPACITY packets.
The default for CAPACITY is 1000.
.PP
\fBMultithreaded Click note:\fR \fBSimpleQueue\fR is designed to be used in an
environment with at most one concurrent pusher and at most one concurrent
puller.  Thus, at most one thread pushes to the \fBSimpleQueue\fR at a time and at
most one thread pulls from the \fBSimpleQueue\fR at a time.  Different threads can
push to and pull from the \fBSimpleQueue\fR concurrently, however.  See
.M ThreadSafeQueue 7
for a queue that can support multiple concurrent pushers and
pullers.
.PP

.SH "NOTES"
The 
.M Queue 7
and 
.M NotifierQueue 7
elements act like \fBSimpleQueue\fR, but additionally
notify interested parties when they change state (from nonempty to empty or
vice versa, and/or from nonfull to full or vice versa).
