.SH "NAME"
ToDevice.u \- Click element;
sends packets to network device (user-level)
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBToDevice\fR(DEVNAME [, \fIkeywords\fR])

\fBPorts\fR: 1 input, at most 2 outputs
.br
\fBProcessing\fR: pull inputs, push outputs
.br
\fBDrivers\fR: userlevel
.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This manual page describes the user-level version of the \fBToDevice\fR element.
For the Linux kernel module element, read the 
.M ToDevice n
manual page.
.PP
Pulls packets and sends them out the named device using
Berkeley Packet Filters (or Linux equivalent).
.PP
Keyword arguments are:
.PP


.IP "BURST" 8
Integer. Maximum number of packets to pull per scheduling. Defaults to 1.
.IP "" 8
.IP "METHOD" 8
Word. Defines the method \fBToDevice\fR will use to write packets to the
device. Linux targets generally support PCAP and LINUX; other targets
support PCAP or, occasionally, other methods. Defaults to the method
specified for a matching 
.M FromDevice n ,
or the first supported
method among NETMAP, PCAP, DEVBPF, LINUX and PCAPFD otherwise.
.IP "" 8
.IP "DEBUG" 8
Boolean.  If true, print out debug messages.
.IP "" 8
.PP
This element is only available at user level.
.PP
.SH "NOTES"
Packets sent via \fBToDevice\fR should already have a link-level
header prepended. This means that ARP processing,
for example, must already have been done.
.PP
The 
.M FromDevice n
element's OUTBOUND keyword argument determines whether
FromDevice receives packets sent by a \fBToDevice\fR element for the same
device.
.PP
Packets that are written successfully are sent on output 0, if it exists.
Packets that fail to be written are pushed out output 1, if it exists.
.PP
.M KernelTun 7
lets you send IP packets to the host kernel's IP processing code,
sort of like the kernel module's ToHost element.
.PP
