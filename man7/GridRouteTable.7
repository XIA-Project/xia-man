.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Implements a DSDV-like loop-free routing protocol by originating
routing messages based on its routing tables, and processing
routing update messages from other nodes.  Maintains an immediate
neighbor table, and a multi-hop route table.  Route entries are
removed TIMEOUT milliseconds after being installed.  PERIOD is the
milliseconds between route broadcasts, randomly offset by up to
JITTER milliseconds.  ETH and IP describe this node's Grid
addresses, and GW is the 
.M GridGatewayInfo 7
element.  
.M LinkTracker 7
and 
.M LinkStat 7
are 
.M LinkTracker 7
and 
.M LinkStat 7
elements for the interface
to which this \fBGridRouteTable\fR element is connected.
.PP
Routing message entries are marked with both a sequence number
(originated by the destination of the entry) and a real-time ttl.
Entries with higher sequence numbers always supersede entries with
lower sequence numbers.  For entries with the same sequence number,
the lower hop-count entry prevails.  Entry ttls decrease while the
entry resides in a node's routing table, as well as being decreased
by a minimum amount when the route is propagated to another node.
Thus an individual route entry will only propagate through the
network for a finite amount of time.  A route entry is not
propagated if its ttl is less than the minimum decrement amount.  A
route is not accepted if its ttl is <= 0.
.PP
New routes are advertised with even sequence numbers originated by
the route destination (obtained from LR_HELLO messages); broken
routes are advertised with odd sequence numbers formed by adding 1
to the sequence number of the last known good route.  Broken route
advertisements are originally initiated when an immediate neighbor
entry times out, and will always supersede the route they are
concerned with; any new route will always supersede the previous
broken route.  When a node receives a broken route advertisement
for a destination to which it knows a newer route, it kills the
broken route advertisement and sends an advertisement for the the
new route.

Keyword arguments are:
.PP


.IP "MAX_HOPS" 8
Integer.  The maximum number of hops for which a route should
propagate.  The default number of hops is 3.
.IP "" 8
.IP "LOGCHANNEL" 8
String.  The name of the chatter channel to which route action log
messages should be logged.  Default channel is ``routelog''.
.IP "" 8
.IP "METRIC" 8
String.  The type of metric that should be used to compare two
routes.  Allowable values are: ``hopcount'',
``cumulative_delivery_rate'', ``min_delivery_rate'',
``min_sig_strength'', and ``min_sig_quality''.  The default is to
use hopcount.
.IP "" 8
.IP "LOG" 8
.M GridLogger 7
element.  Object to log events to.
