.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBFastUDPSource\fR is a benchmark tool. At initialization
time, \fBFastUDPSource\fR creates a UDP/IP packet of length
LENGTH (min 60), with source ethernet address SRCETH,
source IP address SRCIP, source port SPORT,
destination ethernet address DSTETH, destination IP
address DSTIP, and destination port DPORT. The UDP
checksum is calculated if CHECKSUM is true; it is
true by default. Each time the \fBFastUDPSource\fR element
is called, it increments the reference count on the
skbuff created and returns the skbuff object w/o
copying or cloning. Therefore, the packet returned by
\fBFastUDPSource\fR should not be modified.
.PP
\fBFastUDPSource\fR sents packets at RATE packets per
second. It will send LIMIT number of packets in
total.
.PP
After \fBFastUDPSource\fR has sent LIMIT packets, it will
calculate the average send rate (packets per second)
between the first and last packets sent and make that
available in the rate handler.
.PP
By default \fBFastUDPSource\fR is ACTIVE.
.PP
INTERVAL is zero by default. If it is not 0, after
INTERVAL number of packets, both sport and dport will
be incremented by 1. Checksum will be recomputed.
