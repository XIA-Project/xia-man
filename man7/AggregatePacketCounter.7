.TH "AGGREGATEPACKETCOUNTER" 7click "12/Oct/2017" "Click"
.SH "NAME"
AggregatePacketCounter \- Click element;
counts packets per packet number and aggregate annotation
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBAggregatePacketCounter\fR([\fIkeywords\fR PACKETNO])

\fBPorts\fR: 1 or more inputs, 1 or more outputs
.br
\fBProcessing\fR: agnostic
.br
\fBDrivers\fR: userlevel
.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Maintains counts of how many packets seen for each aggregate value and packet
number.  Elements such as 
.M FromCapDump 7 ,
.M AggregateIP 7
and 
.M AggregateIPFlows 7
set
the aggregate annotation; 
.M FromCapDump 7
sets the packet number annotation too.
.PP
\fBAggregatePacketCounter\fR may have any number of inputs, but always has the same
number of outputs as inputs.  Packets arriving on input port \fIN\fR are emitted
on output port \fIN\fR.  The element maintains separate counts for each input.
See the example for how this can be used.
.PP
Keyword arguments are:
.PP


.IP "ANNO" 8
Annotation name.  Defines which packet number annotation to examine.  Normal
choices are PACKET_NUMBER, SEQUENCE_NUMBER, or NONE (do not examine any
annotation), but any 4-byte annotation may be used.  By default, the
PACKET_NUMBER annotation is used.

.SH "ELEMENT HANDLERS"



.IP "\fBcount\fR (read-only)" 5
Returns the total number of packets seen.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBreceived \fIAGG\fB\fR (read-only)" 5
Returns a newline-separated list of packet numbers in aggregate \fIAGG\fR that
were received on any input.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBundelivered \fIAGG\fB\fR (read-only)" 5
Returns a newline-separated list of packet numbers in aggregate \fIAGG\fR that
were received on input 0, but not received on input 1.  Only available if the
element has at least two inputs.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBclear\fR (write-only)" 5
Resets all counts to zero.
.IP "" 5
.PP

.SH "NOTES"
The aggregate identifier is stored in host byte order. Thus, the aggregate ID
corresponding to IP address 128.0.0.0 is 2147483648.
.PP
Only available in user-level processes.
.PP

.SH "EXAMPLES"
This configuration reads sender- and receiver-side packets from 'cap' dumps,
and writes the packet numbers of any undelivered packets to \fI/tmp/x\fR.  It
depends on 
.M FromCapDump 7 's
aggregate, packet number, and paint annotations (note
the use of CheckPaint to ignore acknowledgements).
