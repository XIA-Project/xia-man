.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBFastTCPFlows\fR is a benchmark tool. At initialization time, \fBFastTCPFlows\fR
creates FLOWS number of fake TCP/IP packets of length LENGTH (min 60), with
source ethernet address SRCETH, source IP address SRCIP, destination
ethernet address DSTETH, and destination IP address DSTIP. Source and
destination ports are randomly generated. The TCP checksum is calculated.
Each time the \fBFastTCPFlows\fR element is called, it selects a flow, increments
the reference count on the skbuff created and returns the skbuff object w/o
copying or cloning. Therefore, the packet returned by \fBFastTCPFlows\fR should
not be modified.
.PP
\fBFastTCPFlows\fR sents packets at RATE packets per second. It will send LIMIT
number of packets in total. Each flow is limited to FLOWSIZE number of
packets. After FLOWSIZE number of packets are sent, the sort and dst port
will be modified. FLOWSIZE must be greater than or equal to 3. For each
flow, a SYN packet, a DATA packet, and a FIN packet are sent. These packets
have the invalid sequence numbers, in order to avoid recomputing checksum.
.PP
After \fBFastTCPFlows\fR has sent LIMIT packets, it will calculate the average
send rate (packets per second) between the first and last packets sent and
make that available in the rate handler.
.PP
By default \fBFastTCPFlows\fR is ACTIVE.
