.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBSetPacketType\fR sets passing packets' packet type annotations to TYPE. The
packet type annotation tells Linux about the packet's link-level
characteristics. For example, was the packet sent directly to this host, or
was it broadcast? TYPE should be one of `\f(CWHOST\fR', `\f(CWBROADCAST\fR',
`\f(CWMULTICAST\fR', `\f(CWOTHERHOST\fR', `\f(CWOUTGOING\fR', or `\f(CWLOOPBACK\fR'.
