.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Expects Link probe packets as input.  Records the last WINDOW unique
(not neccessarily sequential) sequence numbers of link probes from
each host, and calculates loss rates over the last TAU milliseconds
for each host.  If the output is connected, sends probe
packets every PERIOD milliseconds.  The source Ethernet
address ETH must be specified if the second output is
connected.

Keyword arguments are:
.PP


.IP "ETH" 8
Ethernet address of this node; required if output is connected.
.IP "" 8
.IP "PERIOD" 8
Unsigned integer.  Millisecond period between sending link probes
if second output is connected.  Defaults to 1000 (1 second).
.IP "" 8
.IP "WINDOW" 8
Unsigned integer.  Number of most recent sequence numbers to remember
for each host.  Defaults to 100.
.IP "" 8
.IP "TAU" 8
Unsigned integer.  Millisecond period over which to calculate loss
rate for each host.  Defaults to 10,000 (10 seconds).
.IP "" 8
.IP "SIZE" 8
Unsigned integer.  Total number of bytes in probe packet, including
ethernet header and above.  Defaults to 1000.
.IP "" 8
.IP "USE_SECOND_PROTO" 8
Boolean.  If true, use the alternate \fBLinkStat\fR ethernet protocol
number.  The normal protocol number is 0x7ffe; the alternate number
is 0x7ffd.  Defaults to false.
