.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Defines new mnemonic names for packet annotations.  Each argument has the form
"NAME OFFSET [SIZE]", which defines NAME as an annotation starting at byte
offset OFFSET and with byte size SIZE.
.PP
The CHECK_OVERLAP argument lets you check whether a set of annotations
overlap.  CHECK_OVERLAP is followed by a list of annotation names; if any of
the named annotations overlap, \fBAnnotationInfo\fR reports an error and fails to
initialize.
.PP
Annotation names defined by default, such as PAINT, may not be redefined.
