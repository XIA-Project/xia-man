.SH "NAME"
RawSocket \- Click element;
transports raw IP packets via safe raw sockets (user-level)
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBRawSocket\fR("TCP", <TCP source port number> [, \fIKEYWORDS\fR])
.br
\fBRawSocket\fR("UDP", <UDP source port number> [, \fIKEYWORDS\fR])

\fBRawSocket\fR("GRE", <GRE key or PPTP call ID> [, \fIKEYWORDS\fR])
.br
\fBRawSocket\fR("ICMP", <ICMP identifier> [, \fIKEYWORDS\fR])

\fBPorts\fR: at most 1 input, at most 1 output
.br
\fBProcessing\fR: pull inputs, push outputs
.br
\fBDrivers\fR: userlevel

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Reads data from and writes data to a raw IPv4 socket. The raw IPv4
socket may optionally be bound to a source port number in the case of
TCP/UDP, a GRE key or PPTP call ID in the case of GRE, or an
identifier in the case of ICMP.  For PlanetLab Linux (versions with VMNET+ onwards)
and TCP or UDP protocol, a seperate SOCK_STREAM or SOCK_DGRAM will be
created and  bound to the specified port. This triggers the slice port registration
mechanism in VMNET+.
.PP
Keyword arguments are:
.PP


.IP "SNAPLEN" 8
Unsigned integer. Maximum packet length. This value
represents the MRU of the \fBRawSocket\fR if it is used as a
packet source. If the MRU is violated by the peer, i.e. if a packet
longer than SNAPLEN is sent, the connection may be terminated.
.IP "" 8
.IP "HEADROOM" 8
Unsigned Integer. Amount of headroom to reserve in packets created
by this element. This could be useful for encapsulation protocols
which add headers to the packet, and can avoid expensive push
operations later in the packet's life.
