.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Forward packets geographically according to the tables accumulated

reported by the

element.  MAC-ADDRESS and
IP-ADDRESS are the local machine's addresses.
.PP
Input 0 expects Grid packets with MAC headers.  Assumes
packets aren't for us.
.PP
Output 0 pushes out packets to be sent by a device, with next hop
info filled in.  These will be Grid packets with MAC headers.
Output packets have their paint annotation set to the output
interface number, e.g. for use with 
.M PaintSwitch 7 .
.PP
Output 1 is the error output: it pushes out packets the
\fBLookupGeographicGridRoute\fR doesn't know how to handle (e.g. we don't
know how to route around a hole, or we don't know our own
location), or are bad (e.g. some type we don't know how to handle).
These will also be Grid packets with MAC headers.
