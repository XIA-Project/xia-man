.SH "NAME"
ToDevice.b \- Click element;
sends packets to network device (BSD kernel)
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBToDevice\fR(DEVNAME [, BURST, \fIKEYWORDS\fR])

\fBPorts\fR: 1 input, no outputs
.br
\fBProcessing\fR: pull
.br
\fBDrivers\fR: bsdmodule
.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This manual page describes the FreeBSD kernel module version of the \fBToDevice\fR
element. For the user-level element, read the 
.M ToDevice.u 7
manual page.
.PP
Pulls packets from its single input and sends them out the FreeBSD network
interface named DEVNAME. DEVNAME may also be an Ethernet address, in which
case \fBToDevice\fR searches for a device with that address.
.PP
Sends up to BURST packets each time it is scheduled. By default, BURST is 16.
For good performance, you should set BURST to be 8 times the number of
elements that could generate packets for this device.
.PP
Packets must have a link header. For Ethernet, \fBToDevice\fR makes sure every
packet is at least 60 bytes long.
.PP
Keyword arguments are:
.PP


.IP "BURST" 8
Unsigned integer. Same as the BURST argument.
.IP "" 8
.IP "ALLOW_NONEXISTENT" 8
Allow nonexistent devices. If true, and no device named DEVNAME exists when
the router is initialized, then \fBToDevice\fR will report a warning (rather than an
error). Later, while the router is running, if a device named DEVNAME appears,
\fBToDevice\fR will seamlessly begin sending packets to it. Default is false.
.IP "" 8
.PP

.SH "NOTES"
The FreeBSD networking code may also send packets out the device. Click won't
see those packets. Worse, FreeBSD may cause the device to be busy when a
\fBToDevice\fR wants to send a packet. Click is not clever enough to re-queue
such packets, and discards them.
.PP
\fBToDevice\fR's depend on the net driver's send operation for synchronization
