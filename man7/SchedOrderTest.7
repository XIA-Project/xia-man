.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBSchedOrderTest\fR(ID, [<keyword> SIZE, LIMIT, STOP])

\fBPorts\fR: none

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBSchedOrderTest\fR elements repeatedly schedule themselves, and keep track of the
order in which they were scheduled.  ID is an integer used to distinguish
between different \fBSchedOrderTest\fR elements.  The "order" handler reports the
sequence of IDs corresponding to the order in which the first SIZE
\fBSchedOrderTest\fR tasks were scheduled.  Use 
.M ScheduleInfo 7
to set \fBSchedOrderTest\fR's
tickets.
.PP


.IP "SIZE" 8
Integer.  The maximum length of the stored ID sequence.  Default is 1024.
.IP "" 8
.IP "LIMIT" 8
Unsigned.  \fBSchedOrderTest\fR will schedule itself at most LIMIT times.  0 means
forever.  Default is 0.
.IP "" 8
.IP "STOP" 8
Boolean.  If true, \fBSchedOrderTest\fR will stop the driver when the ID sequence is
full.  (Note that this has to do with SIZE, not LIMIT.)  Default is false.
