.SH "NAME"
RatedSplitter \- Click element;
splits flow of packets at specified rate
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBRatedSplitter\fR(RATE, I[<KEYWORDS>])

\fBPorts\fR: 1 input, 1-2 outputs
.br
\fBProcessing\fR: Push
.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBRatedSplitter\fR has two output ports. All incoming packets up to a maximum of
RATE packets per second are emitted on output port 0. Any remaining packets
are emitted on output port 1. Unlike 
.M Meter 7 ,
RATE packets per second are
emitted on output port 0 even when the input rate is greater than RATE.
.PP
Like 
.M RatedUnqueue 7 ,
\fBRatedSplitter\fR is implemented using a token bucket that
defaults to a capacity of 20ms * RATE.  The capacity can be changed with the
BURST_DURATION and BURST_SIZE keyword configuration parameters.

.SH "EXAMPLES"

.nf
\& rs :: RatedSplitter(2000);
.fi
.PP
Split packets on port 0 at 2000 packets per second.
.PP
.nf
\& elementclass RatedSampler {
\& input -> rs :: RatedSplitter(2000);
\& rs [0] -> t :: Tee;
\& t [0] -> [0] output;
\& t [1] -> [1] output;
\& rs [1] -> [0] output;
\& };
.fi
.PP
In the above example, RatedSampler is a compound element that samples input
packets at 2000 packets per second. All traffic is emitted on output 0; a
maximum of 2000 packets per second are emitted on output 1 as well.
