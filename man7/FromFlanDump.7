.SH "NAME"
FromFlanDump \- Click element;
reads packets from a DAG file
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBFromFlanDump\fR(FILENAME [, \fIKEYWORDS\fR])

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Reads packets from a file in DAG format, produced by the University of
Waikato's DAG tools. Pushes them out the output, and optionally stops the
driver when there are no more packets. If TIMING is true, then \fBFromFlanDump\fR
tries to maintain the timing of the original packet stream. TIMING is false by
default.
.PP
\fBFromFlanDump\fR also transparently reads gzip- and bzip2-compressed files, if you
have zcat(1) and bzcat(1) installed.
.PP
Keyword arguments are:
.PP


.IP "SAMPLE" 8
Unsigned real number between 0 and 1. \fBFromFlanDump\fR will output each packet with
probability SAMPLE. Default is 1. \fBFromFlanDump\fR uses fixed-point arithmetic, so
the actual sampling probability may differ substantially from the requested
sampling probability. Use the \f(CWsampling_prob\fR handler to find out the actual
probability.
.IP "" 8
.IP "STOP" 8
Boolean. If true, then \fBFromFlanDump\fR will ask the router to stop when it is done
reading its tcpdump file. Default is false.
.IP "" 8
.IP "START" 8
Absolute time in seconds since the epoch. \fBFromFlanDump\fR will output packets with
timestamps after that time.
.IP "" 8
.IP "START_AFTER" 8
Argument is relative time in seconds (or supply a suffix like `min', `h').
\fBFromFlanDump\fR will skip the first \fIT\fR seconds in the log.
.IP "" 8
.IP "END" 8
Absolute time in seconds since the epoch. \fBFromFlanDump\fR will stop when
encountering a packet with timestamp at or after that time.
.IP "" 8
.IP "END_AFTER" 8
Argument is relative time in seconds (or supply a suffix like `min', `h').
\fBFromFlanDump\fR will stop at the first packet whose timestamp is at least \fIT\fR
seconds after the first timestamp in the log.
.IP "" 8
.IP "INTERVAL" 8
Argument is relative time in seconds (or supply a suffix like `min', `h').
\fBFromFlanDump\fR will stop at the first packet whose timestamp is at least \fIT\fR
seconds after the first packet output.
.IP "" 8
.IP "END_CALL" 8
Specify the handler to call, instead of stopping \fBFromFlanDump\fR, once the end
time is reached.
.IP "" 8
.IP "TIMING" 8
Boolean. Same as the TIMING argument.
.IP "" 8
.IP "ACTIVE" 8
Boolean. If false, then \fBFromFlanDump\fR will not emit packets (until the
`\f(CWactive\fR' handler is written). Default is true.
.IP "" 8
.IP "MMAP" 8
Boolean. If true, then \fBFromFlanDump\fR will use 
.M mmap 2
to access the tcpdump
file. This can result in slightly better performance on some machines.
\fBFromFlanDump\fR's regular file discipline is pretty optimized, so the difference
is often small in practice. Default is true on most operating systems, but
false on Linux.
.IP "" 8
.PP
You can supply at most one of START and START_AFTER, and at most one of END,
END_AFTER, and INTERVAL.
.PP
Only available in user-level processes.
.PP
.SH "NOTES"
By default, `tcpdump -w FILENAME' dumps only the first 68 bytes of
each packet. You probably want to run `tcpdump -w FILENAME -s 2000' or some
such.
.PP
\fBFromFlanDump\fR sets packets' extra length annotations to any additional length
recorded in the dump.

.SH "ELEMENT HANDLERS"



.IP "\fBsampling_prob\fR (read-only)" 5
Returns the sampling probability (see the SAMPLE keyword argument).
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBactive\fR (read/write)" 5
Value is a Boolean.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBencap\fR (read-only)" 5
Returns the file's encapsulation type.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBfilesize\fR (read-only)" 5
Returns the length of the \fBFromFlanDump\fR file, in bytes, or "-" if that
length cannot be determined.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBfilepos\fR (read-only)" 5
Returns \fBFromFlanDump\fR's position in the file, in bytes.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBextend_interval\fR (write-only)" 5
Text is a time interval. If END_TIME or one of its cousins was specified, then
writing to this handler extends END_TIME by that many seconds. Also, ACTIVE is
set to true.
