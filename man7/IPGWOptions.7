.SH "NAME"
IPGWOptions \- Click element;
processes router IP options
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBIPGWOptions\fR(MYADDR [, OTHERADDRS])

\fBPorts\fR: 1 input, 1-2 outputs
.br
\fBProcessing\fR: agnostic, but output 1 is push
.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Process the IP options that should be processed by every router,
not just when ip_dst refers to the current router. At the moment
that amounts to Record Route and Timestamp (in particular,
not the source route options). MYADDR is the router's
IP address on the interface downstream from the element.
.PP
Probably needs to be placed on the output path, since MYADDR
must be the outgoing interface's IP address (rfc1812 4.2.2.2).
.PP
Recomputes the IP header checksum if it modifies the packet.
.PP
The optional OTHERADDRS argument should be a space-separated list of IP
addresses containing the router's other interface addresses. It is used to
implement the Timestamp option.
.PP
The second output may be connected to an 
.M ICMPError 7
to produce
a parameter problem (type=12,code=0) message. \fBIPGWOptions\fR sets
the param_off packet annotation so that 
.M ICMPError 7
can set
the Parameter Problem pointer to point to the erroneous byte.
