.SH "NAME"
TimedUnqueue \- Click element;
pull-to-push converter
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBTimedUnqueue\fR(INTERVAL [, BURST])

\fBPorts\fR: 1 input, 1 output
.br
\fBProcessing\fR: pull inputs, push outputs
.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Pulls at most BURST packets per INTERVAL (seconds) from its input, pushing
them out its single output.  Default BURST is 1.
.PP
If BURST is 1, and packets arrive upstream at a rate of less than 1 packet
per INTERVAL, then in steady state \fBTimedUnqueue\fR will impose relatively
little delay on the packet stream.  In other situations, \fBTimedUnqueue\fR may
impose an average delay of INTERVAL/2 seconds per packet, even for low
input rates.  This is because it checks for packets at most once every
INTERVAL seconds.
.PP
There is usually a Queue upstream of each \fBTimedUnqueue\fR element.
.PP

.SH "NOTES"
The UNIX and Linux timers have granularity of about 10
milliseconds, so this \fBTimedUnqueue\fR can only produce high packet
rates by being bursty.
