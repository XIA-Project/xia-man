.SH "NAME"
AggregateFilter \- Click element;
filters packets based on aggregate annotation
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBAggregateFilter\fR(ACTION_1 AGGREGATES, ..., ACTION_N AGGREGATES)

\fBPorts\fR: 1 input, 1-254 outputs

\fBProcessing\fR: push

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Filters packets based on their aggregate annotations. \fBAggregateFilter\fR's
configuration string is an arbitrary number of filters, which are
ACTION-AGGREGATES pairs. Packets are tested against the filters in order and
processed according to the ACTION in the first filter that matched. A packet
matches a filter if its aggregate annotation is listed in that filter's
AGGREGATES.
.PP
Each ACTION is either a port number, which specifies that the packet should be
sent out on that port; 'allow', which is equivalent to '0'; or 'drop' or
\&'deny', which means drop the packet. Packets that match none of the filters
are dropped. \fBAggregateFilter\fR has an arbitrary number of outputs.
.PP
The AGGREGATES arguments are space-separated lists of aggregate values, which
are unsigned integers. You can also specify ranges like '0-98'. The special
AGGREGATES 'all' and '-' both correspond to all aggregates.
.PP
\fBAggregateFilter\fR will warn about aggregate filters that match no packets, or
AGGREGATES components that were ignored (because of an earlier filter matching
the same aggregate).
