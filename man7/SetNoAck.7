.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Sets the WIFI_EXTRA_TX_NOACK in wifi_extra_anno. This will make 
RadiotapEncap() set the TX flag IEEE80211_RADIOTAP_F_TX_NOACK, 
and that again will make mac80211 based drivers set the 
IEEE80211_TX_CTL_NO_ACK flag in the annotation of the outgoing packet. 
Rate control is bypassed, and the packet is sent only once with 
the rate specified by SetTXRate(). If the receiver is a monitor, there 
will be no ACK.
