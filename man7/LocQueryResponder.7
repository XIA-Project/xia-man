.SH "NAME"
LocQueryResponder \- Click element;
generates responses to Grid Location queries
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBLocQueryResponder\fR(E, I)

\fBPorts\fR: 1 input, 1 output

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
E and I are this node's ethernet and IP addresses, respectively.
Input should be Grid location query packets destined for us,
including the MAC header.  Produces a GRID_LOC_REPLY packet with
the correct destination IP and location information.  This packet
should probably be sent back through a routing element,
e.g. through 
.M LookupLocalGridRoute 7 's
MAC layer input, and then
through 
.M FixSrcLoc 7
(to actually get this node's location information
into the packet).
