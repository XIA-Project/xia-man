.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Input packets need to be IPv4 (no ether header &c).
It's OK if they're not TCP.
.PP
How to specify various kinds of output? There is not really
a useful general standard. Perhaps emit each different format
of output on a different output() and let further modules
sort it out. Then we wouldn't be AGNOSTIC...
