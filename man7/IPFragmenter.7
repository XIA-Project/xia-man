.TH "IPFRAGMENTER" 7click "12/Oct/2017" "Click"
.SH "NAME"
IPFragmenter \- Click element;
fragments large IP packets
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBIPFragmenter\fR(MTU, [\fIkeywords\fR HONOR_DF, VERBOSE])

\fBPorts\fR: 1 input, 1-2 outputs
.br
\fBProcessing\fR: push
.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Expects IP packets as input. If the IP packet size is <= MTU, just emits
the packet on output 0. If the size is greater than MTU and the
don't-fragment bit (DF) isn't set, \fBIPFragmenter\fR splits the packet into
fragments emitted on output 0. If DF is set and the packet size is greater
than MTU, sends the packet to output 1 (but see HONOR_DF below). Ordinarily
output 1 is connected to an 
.M ICMPError 7
element with type 3 (UNREACH) and
code 4 (NEEDFRAG).
.PP
Copies all annotations to the fragments.
.PP
Sends the fragments in order, starting with the first.
.PP
It is best to Strip() the MAC header from a packet before sending it to
\fBIPFragmenter\fR, since any MAC header is not copied to second and subsequent
fragments.
.PP
Keyword arguments are:
.PP


.IP "HONOR_DF" 8
Boolean. If HONOR_DF is false, \fBIPFragmenter\fR will ignore the don't-fragment
(DF) bit and fragment every packet larger than MTU. Default is true.
.IP "" 8
.IP "VERBOSE" 8
Boolean.  If true, \fBIPFragmenter\fR will print a message every time it sees a
packet with DF; otherwise, it will print a message only the first 5 times.
Default is false.
.IP "" 8
.IP "HEADROOM" 8
Unsigned.  Sets the headroom on the output packets to an explicit value,
rather than the default (which is usually about 28 bytes).
.IP "" 8
