.SH "NAME"
ARPResponder \- Click element;
generates responses to ARP queries
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBARPResponder\fR(IP/MASK [IP/MASK...] ETH, IP2/MASK2 ETH2, ...)

\fBPorts\fR: 1 input, 1-2 outputs
.br
\fBProcessing\fR: agnostic, but output 1 is push
.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Input should be ARP request packets, including the Ethernet header.
Forwards an ARP reply if we know the answer -- that is, if one of the
IPPREFIX arguments matches the requested IP address, then it outputs an ARP
reply giving the corresponding ETH address, otherwise the ARP request
packet is pushed out of output 1 (if it exists). Could be used for proxy
ARP as well as producing replies for a host's own address.
.PP
The IP/MASK arguments are IP network addresses (IP address/netmask pairs).
The netmask can be specified in CIDR form (`\f(CW18.26.7.0/24\fR') or dotted
decimal form (`\f(CW18.26.7.0/255.255.255.0\fR').
.PP
\fBARPResponder\fR sets the device and VLAN TCI annotations on generated ARP
responses to the corresponding annotations from the queries.
.PP

.SH "NOTES"
.M AddressInfo 7
elements can simplify the arguments to \fBARPResponder\fR. In
particular, if \f(CWNAME\fR is shorthand for both an IP network address (or IP
address) \f(CWIP\fR and an Ethernet address \f(CWETH\fR, then \f(CWARPResponder(NAME)\fR is
equivalent to \f(CWARPResponder(IP ETH)\fR. If \f(CWNAME\fR is short for both an IP
address and an IP network address, then \fBARPResponder\fR will prefer the IP
address. (You can say \f(CWNAME:ipnet\fR to use the IP network address.)

.SH "ELEMENT HANDLERS"



.IP "\fBtable\fR (read-only)" 5
Return the \fBARPResponder\fR's current table, with one IP network entry per
line.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBlookup\fR (read with parameters)" 5
Takes an IP address as a parameter and returns the corresponding Ethernet
address, if any.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBadd\fR (write-only)" 5
Add new entries.  Takes a string in "IP/MASK [IP/MASK...] ETH" form.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBremove\fR (write-only)" 5
Delete a single entry.  Takes a string in "IP/MASK" form; deletes any
entry with the same IP and MASK.
.IP "" 5
.PP

.SH "EXAMPLES"
Produce ARP replies for the local machine (18.26.4.24)
as well as proxy ARP for all machines on net 18.26.7
directing their packets to the local machine:
