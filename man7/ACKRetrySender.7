.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Input 0 should be Ethernet packets.  Input 1 should be
acknowledgements.  When a packet is pulled in on input 0, it is
pushed on output 0, and cached until a positive acknowledgement
(ACK) is received.  If no ACK is received before the resend timer
expires, the packet is resent.  If the packet has been resent too
many times, it is pushed to output 1.  If output 1 is not
connected, it is dropped.
