\fBSuppressor\fR has \fIn\fR inputs and \fIn\fR outputs. It generally passes packets
from input \fIi\fR to output \fIi\fR unchanged. However, any input port can be
suppressed, through a handler or a method call by another element. Packets
arriving on suppressed push input ports are dropped; pull requests arriving
on suppressed pull output ports are ignored.
