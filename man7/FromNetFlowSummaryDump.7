.SH "NAME"
FromNetFlowSummaryDump \- Click element;
reads packets from a NetFlow summary file
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBFromNetFlowSummaryDump\fR(FILE [, \fIKEYWORDS\fR])

\fBPorts\fR: no inputs, 1 output
.br
\fBProcessing\fR: agnostic
.br
\fBDrivers\fR: userlevel
.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Reads IP packet descriptors from a file containing NetFlow data, in the ASCII
summary format described below, then creates packets containing info from the
descriptors and pushes them out the output. Optionally stops the driver when
there are no more packets.
.PP
FILE may be compressed with gzip(1) or bzip2(1); \fBFromNetFlowSummaryDump\fR will
run zcat(1) or bzcat(1) to uncompress it.
.PP
Keyword arguments are:
.PP


.IP "STOP" 8
Boolean. If true, then \fBFromNetFlowSummaryDump\fR will ask the router to stop when
it is done reading. Default is false.
.IP "" 8
.IP "ACTIVE" 8
Boolean. If false, then \fBFromNetFlowSummaryDump\fR will not emit packets (until
the `\f(CWactive\fR' handler is written). Default is true.
.IP "" 8
.IP "ZERO" 8
Boolean. If true (the default), then emitted packet data is zero, except for
data set by the dump. If false, this data is random garbage.
.IP "" 8
.IP "MULTIPACKET" 8
Boolean. If true, then generate multiple packets for each flow, according to
the flow's packet count. Packet timestamps vary smoothly from the flow start
timestamp to the flow end timestamp. Default is false.
.IP "" 8
.IP "LINK" 8
Sets the interface type used to set the paint annotation.  Can be "input",
"output", or "both", which means the upper 4 bits of the annotation are the
input interface and the lower 4 bits are the output interface.  Too-large
interface numbers are pinned at 255 (or 15, for "both").  Default is "input".
.IP "" 8
.IP "TIMING" 8
Boolean.  If true, FromNetDlowSummaryDump tries to maintain the timing of the
original packet stream.  TIMING is false by default.
.IP "" 8
.PP
Only available in user-level processes.
.PP
.SH "NOTES"
Packets generated by \fBFromNetFlowSummaryDump\fR always have IP version 4 and IP
header length 5.  The rest of the packet data is zero or garbage, unless set
by the dump.  Generated packets will usually have incorrect checksums.  The
link annotation is equal to one of the interface numbers, or a combination of
both.
.PP

.SH "FILE FORMAT"
\fBFromNetFlowSummaryDump\fR reads line-oriented ASCII files. Blank lines, and lines
starting with `\f(CW!\fR' or `\f(CW#\fR', are ignored. Data lines contain 15 or more
fields separated by vertical bars `\f(CW|\fR'. \fBFromNetFlowSummaryDump\fR pays
attention to some of these fields:

.PP
Generated packets have both their "first timestamp" and timestamp annotations
set. The timestamp annotation is set to the flow end timestamp unless that was
zero, in which case it is set to the flow timestamp. The "first timestamp"
annotation is always set to the flow timestamp.
.PP
\fBFromNetFlowSummaryDump\fR is a notifier signal, active when the element is active
and the dump contains more packets.
.PP


.SH "ELEMENT HANDLERS"



.IP "\fBactive\fR (read/write)" 5
Value is a Boolean.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBencap\fR (read-only)" 5
Returns `IP'. Useful for ToDump's USE_ENCAP_FROM option.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBfilesize\fR (read-only)" 5
Returns the length of the NetFlow summary file, in bytes, or "-" if that
length cannot be determined.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBfilepos\fR (read-only)" 5
Returns \fBFromNetFlowSummaryDump\fR's position in the file, in bytes.
