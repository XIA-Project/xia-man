.SH "NAME"
Counter \- Click element;
measures packet count and rate
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBCounter\fR([\fIkeywords COUNT_CALL, BYTE_COUNT_CALL\fR])

\fBPorts\fR: 1 input, 1 output
.br
\fBProcessing\fR: agnostic
.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Passes packets unchanged from its input to its output, maintaining statistics
information about packet count and packet rate.
.PP
Keyword arguments are:
.PP


.IP "COUNT_CALL" 8
Argument is `\fIN\fR \fIHANDLER\fR [\fIVALUE\fR]'. When the packet count reaches \fIN\fR,
call the write handler \fIHANDLER\fR with value \fIVALUE\fR before emitting the
packet.
.IP "" 8
.IP "BYTE_COUNT_CALL" 8
Argument is `\fIN\fR \fIHANDLER\fR [\fIVALUE\fR]'. When the byte count reaches or
exceeds \fIN\fR, call the write handler \fIHANDLER\fR with value \fIVALUE\fR before
emitting the packet.

.SH "ELEMENT HANDLERS"



.IP "\fBcount\fR (read-only)" 5
Returns the number of packets that have passed through since the last reset.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBbyte_count\fR (read-only)" 5
Returns the number of bytes that have passed through since the last reset.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBrate\fR (read-only)" 5
Returns the recent arrival rate, measured by exponential
weighted moving average, in packets per second.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBbit_rate\fR (read-only)" 5
Returns the recent arrival rate, measured by exponential
weighted moving average, in bits per second.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBbyte_rate\fR (read-only)" 5
Returns the recent arrival rate, measured by exponential
weighted moving average, in bytes per second.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBreset_counts\fR (write-only)" 5
Resets the counts and rates to zero.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBreset\fR (write-only)" 5
Same as 'reset_counts'.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBcount_call\fR (write-only)" 5
Writes a new COUNT_CALL argument. The handler can be omitted.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBbyte_count_call\fR (write-only)" 5
Writes a new BYTE_COUNT_CALL argument. The handler can be omitted.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBCLICK_LLRPC_GET_RATE\fR (llrpc)" 5
Argument is a pointer to an integer that must be 0.  Returns the recent
arrival rate (measured by exponential weighted moving average) in
packets per second.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBCLICK_LLRPC_GET_COUNT\fR (llrpc)" 5
Argument is a pointer to an integer that must be 0 (packet count) or 1 (byte
count). Returns the current packet or byte count.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBCLICK_LLRPC_GET_COUNTS\fR (llrpc)" 5
Argument is a pointer to a click_llrpc_counts_st structure (see
<click/llrpc.h>). The \f(CWkeys\fR components must be 0 (packet count) or 1 (byte
count). Stores the corresponding counts in the corresponding \f(CWvalues\fR
components.
