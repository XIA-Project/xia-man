.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Sets the current process's effective user and group IDs to its real user and
group IDs, respectively.  This relinquishes any set-uid-root privilege.
.PP

.SH "NOTES"
\fBChangeUID\fR's configure phase is set so that it runs immediately after the
"privileged" elements FromDevice.u and ToDevice.u, but before most other
elements.  Thus, this configuration:
.PP
.nf
\&   f1 :: FromDevice(eth0) -> ...
\&   f2 :: FromDump(/tmp/x) -> ...
\&   ChangeUID()
.fi
.PP
should fail to initialize if the user cannot read file \fI/tmp/x\fR.  However,
your mileage may vary.  Set-uid-root programs are a bad idea, and Click is no
exception.
