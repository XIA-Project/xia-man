.SH "NAME"
FromDPDKDevice \- Click element;
reads packets from network device using Intel's DPDK (user-level)
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBFromDPDKDevice\fR(PORT [, QUEUE [, \fIkeywords\fR PROMISC, BURST, NDESC]])

\fBPorts\fR: no inputs, 1 output

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Reads packets from the network device with DPDK port identifier PORT.
.PP
On the contrary to FromDevice.u which acts as a sniffer by default, packets
received by devices put in DPDK mode will NOT be received by the kernel, and
will thus be processed only once.
.PP
Arguments:
.PP


.IP "PORT" 8
Integer.  Port identifier of the device.
.IP "" 8
.IP "QUEUE" 8
