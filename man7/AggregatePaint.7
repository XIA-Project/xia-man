.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBAggregatePaint\fR sets the aggregate annotation on every passing packet to a
portion of that packet's paint annotation.  By default, it is simply set to
the paint annotation; but if you specify a number for BITS, then only the
low-order BITS bits of the annotation are used.

.IP "INCREMENTAL" 8
Boolean.  If true, then incrementally update the aggregate annotation: given a
paint annotation with value V, and an old aggregate annotation of O, the new
aggregate annotation will equal (O * 2^LENGTH) + V.  Default is false.
