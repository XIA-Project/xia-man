CompareBlock \- Click element;
drops packets out of rate range
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBCompareBlock\fR(FWD_WEIGHT, REV_WEIGHT, THRESH)

\fBPorts\fR: 1 input, 2 outputs
.br
\fBProcessing\fR: agnostic
.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
FWD_WEIGHT, REV_WEIGHT, and THRESH are integers
.PP
Splits packets based on the fwd_rate_anno and rev_rate_anno rate annotations
set by 
.M IPRateMonitor 7 .
If either annotation is greater than THRESH,
and FWD_WEIGHT*fwd_rate_anno > REV_WEIGHT*rev_rate_anno,
the packet is pushed on output 1, otherwise on output 0.
.PP

.SH "EXAMPLES"

.nf
\& b :: CompareBlock(5, 2, 100);
.fi
.PP
if (5*fwd_rate > 2*rev_rate) AND (fwd_rate > 100 or rev_rate > 100), send
packet out on output 1, otherwise on output 0.
