Each time a pull comes in the output, \fBPrioSched\fR pulls from
each of the inputs starting from input 0.
The packet from the first successful pull is returned.
This amounts to a strict priority scheduler.

The inputs usually come from Queues or other pull schedulers.
\fBPrioSched\fR uses notification to avoid pulling from empty inputs.
