element.  This is the 
.M ToUserDevice 7
element that set up the actual
character device.  The element must be of 'TYPE packet,' as \fBFromUserDevice\fR does
not support the streaming interfaces or encapsulations.  If only the
\fBFromUserDevice\fR functionality is desired, then just include
"Idle -> my_tud :: 
.M ToUserDevice 7 "(...);\(dq"
in the config.
.IP "" 8
.IP "CAPACITY" 8
Unsigned integer.  Sets the CAPACITY of the internal ring buffer that stores the
packets.  Defaults to 64.

headroom.
.IP "" 8
.IP "TAILROOM" 8
Unsigned integer.  Sets the tailroom on packets.  Defaults to 0.
.IP "" 8
.IP "MAX_PACKET_SIZE" 8
