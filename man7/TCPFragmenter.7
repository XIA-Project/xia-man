.SH "NAME"
TCPFragmenter \- Click element;
fragments TCP packets to a maximum TCP payload size
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBTCPFragmenter\fR(MTU)

\fBPorts\fR: 1 input, 1 output

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
TCP Packets with payload length greater than the MTU are fragmented into
multiple packets each containing at most MTU bytes of TCP payload.  Each of
these new packets will be a copy of the input packet except for checksums (ip
and tcp), length (ip length), and tcp sequence number (for all fragments except
the first).  This means that \fBTCPFragmenter\fR can operate on packets that have
ethernet headers, and all ethernet headers will be copied to each fragment.
.PP

.IP "MTU" 8
Unsigned. If MTU is non-zero, then fragment every packet larger than MTU.
.PP
.IP "MTU_ANNO" 8
Two Byte Annotation. If specified and annotation is non zero, then
fragment every packet larger than the annotation's value.
