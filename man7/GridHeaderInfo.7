.SH "NAME"
GridHeaderInfo \- Click element;
Provide information about Grid header version, header sizes, and offsets
for the current router exectuable.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBGridHeaderInfo\fR

\fBPorts\fR: None
.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This element can be used by scripts to find out various sizes and
offsets of the Grid protocol headers.
.PP
The point of this element is to provide information that can be
used to properly build Grid click configurations -- some of the
classifiers etc. require offset information.  Probably this whole
approach is broken and I should just write a GridClassifier... but
then what's the point of a generic classifier?  I am confused...
.PP
The following handler documentation may not be exhaustive, or may
be out of date; use the ``handlers'' handler to see what is
actually available.
