.SH "NAME"
EtherSwitch \- Click element;
learning, forwarding Ethernet switch
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBEtherSwitch\fR([\fIkeywords\fR TIMEOUT])

\fBPorts\fR: 2 or more inputs, the same number of outputs
.br
\fBProcessing\fR: push
.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Expects and produces Ethernet packets.  Each pair of corresponding ports
(e.g., input 0 and output 0, and input 1 and output 1, and so forth)
corresponds to a LAN.  Acts as a learning, forwarding Ethernet switch among
those LANs.
.PP
On receiving a packet on input port I with source address A, \fBEtherSwitch\fR
associates A with I.  Future packets destined for A are sent to output I
(unless they came from input I, in which case they are dropped).  Packets sent
to an unknown destination address are forwarded to every output port, except
the one corresponding to the packet's input port.  The TIMEOUT parameter
affects how long port associations last.  If it is 0, then the element does
not learn addresses, and acts like a dumb hub.
.PP
Keyword arguments are:
.PP


.IP "TIMEOUT" 8
The timeout for port associations, in seconds.  Any port mapping (i.e.,
binding between an address and a port number) is dropped after TIMEOUT seconds
of inactivity.  If 0, the element acts like a dumb hub.  Default is 300.
.IP "" 8
.PP

.SH "NOTES"
The \fBEtherSwitch\fR element has no limit on the memory consumed by cached Ethernet
addresses.
