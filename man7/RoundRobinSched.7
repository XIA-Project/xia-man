.SH "NAME"
RoundRobinSched \- Click element;
pulls from round-robin inputs
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBRoundRobinSched\fR

\fBPorts\fR: one output, zero or more inputs
.br
\fBProcessing\fR: pull
.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Each time a pull comes in the output, pulls from its inputs
in turn until one produces a packet. When the next pull
comes in, it starts from the input after the one that
last produced a packet. This amounts to a round robin
scheduler.
.PP
The inputs usually come from Queues or other pull schedulers.
\fBRoundRobinSched\fR uses notification to avoid pulling from empty inputs.
