.SH "NAME"
LookupLocalGridRoute \- Click element;

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBLookupLocalGridRoute\fR(ETH, IP, 
.M GenericGridRouteTable 7 ,

\fBPorts\fR: 2 inputs, 4 outputs

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Forward packets according to the tables accumulated by the
.M GenericGridRouteTable 7
element.  MAC-ADDRESS and IP-ADDRESS are the local
machine's addresses.
.PP
Input 0 is from the device, output 0 is to the device.  Both should
be GRID_NBR_ENCAP packets with MAC headers.  Output packets have
their paint annotation set to the output interface number, e.g. for
use with 
.M PaintSwitch 7 .
.PP
Input 1 is down from higher level protocols, output 1 is is up to
higher level protocols. The format of both is IP packets.
.PP
Output 2 pushes out packets that \fBLookupLocalGridRoute\fR doesn't know
what to do with (we don't know have a route with a next hop), but
are still valid.  e.g. to be sent to geographic forwarding.  These
packets are GRID_NBR_ENCAP packets with MAC headers.
.PP
Output 3 is the error output; it pushes out packets that are bad:
e.g., Grid protocol packets with an unknown type.
.PP
Keywords are:
