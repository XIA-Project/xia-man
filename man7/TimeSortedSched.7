.SH "NAME"
TimeSortedSched \- Click element;
merge sorted packet streams by timestamp
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBTimeSortedSched\fR(\fIkeywords\fR STOP, BUFFER)

\fBPorts\fR: one output, zero or more inputs
.br
\fBProcessing\fR: pull
.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBTimeSortedSched\fR responds to pull requests by returning the chronologically
next packet pulled from its inputs, determined by packet timestamps.
.PP
\fBTimeSortedSched\fR expects its input packet streams to arrive sorted by
timestamp.  If the \f(CWwell_ordered\fR handler returns "false", then one or more
packet streams did not arrive correctly sorted by timestamp, so
\fBTimeSortedSched\fR emitted some packets out of order.  (But see BUFFER, below.)
.PP
\fBTimeSortedSched\fR listens for notification from its inputs to avoid useless
pulls, and provides notification for its output.
.PP
Keyword arguments are:
.PP


.IP "STOP" 8
Boolean. If true, stop the driver when there are no packets available (and the
upstream notifiers indicate that no packets will become available soon).
Default is false.
.IP "" 8
.IP "BUFFER" 8
Integer. Up to BUFFER packets per input are buffered within
\fBTimeSortedSched\fR. Default BUFFER is 1. Higher BUFFER values let \fBTimeSortedSched\fR
cope with minor reordering in its input streams.
.IP "" 8
.PP

.SH "NOTES"
\fBTimeSortedSched\fR is a notifier signal, active iff any of the upstream notifiers
are active.
.PP

.SH "EXAMPLES"
This example merges multiple tcpdump(1) files into a single, time-sorted
stream, and stops the driver when all the files are exhausted.
.PP

.SH "ELEMENT HANDLERS"



.IP "\fBwell_ordered\fR (read-only)" 5
Returns a Boolean string. If "false", then \fBTimeSortedSched\fR's output was not
properly sorted by increasing timestamp, because one or more of its input
streams was not so sorted.
