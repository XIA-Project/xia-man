.TH "XARPQUERIER" 7click "12/Oct/2017" "Click"
.SH "NAME"
XARPQuerier \- Click element;
encapsulates XIP packets in Ethernet headers found via XARP
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBXARPQuerier\fR(XIP, ETH, \fIkeywords\fR)
.br
\fBXARPQuerier\fR(NAME, \fIkeywords\fR)

\fBPorts\fR: 2 inputs, 1-2 outputs
.br
\fBProcessing\fR: push
.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Handles most of the XARP protocol. Argument IP should be
this host's XIP address, and ETH should be this host's
Ethernet address. (In
the one-argument form, NAME should be shorthand for
both an XIP and an Ethernet address; see 
.M AddressInfo 7 (n).)
.PP
Packets arriving on input 0 should be XIP packets, and must have their
destination address annotations set.
If an Ethernet address is already known
for the destination, the XIP packet is wrapped in an Ethernet
header and sent to output 0. Otherwise the XIP packet is saved and
an XARP query is sent instead. If an XARP response arrives
on input 1 for an XIP address that we need, the mapping is
recorded and any saved XIP packets are sent.
.PP
The XARP reply packets on input 1 should include the Ethernet header.
.PP
\fBXARPQuerier\fR may have one or two outputs. If it has two, then XARP queries
are sent to the second output.
.PP
\fBXARPQuerier\fR implements special behavior for 0.0.0.0, 255.255.255.255, multicast
addresses, and, if specified, any BROADCAST address.  Packets addressed to
0.0.0.0 are dropped.  Packets for broadcast addresses are forwarded with
destination Ethernet address FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF.  Multicast XIP addresses are
forwarded to 01-00-5E-xx-yy-zz, where xx-yy-zz are the lower 23 bits of the
multicast XIP address, as specified in RFC1112.

.IP "TABLE" 8
Element.  Names an 
.M XARPTable 7
element that holds this element's corresponding
XARP state.  By default \fBXARPQuerier\fR creates its own internal 
.M XARPTable 7
and uses
that.  If TABLE is specified, CAPACITY, ENTRY_CAPACITY, and TIMEOUT are
ignored.
.IP "" 8
.IP "CAPACITY" 8
Unsigned integer.  The maximum number of saved XIP packets the table will
hold at a time.  Default is 2048.
.IP "" 8
.IP "ENTRY_CAPACITY" 8
Unsigned integer.  The maximum number of XARP entries the table will hold
at a time.  Default is 0, which means unlimited.
.IP "" 8
.IP "TIMEOUT" 8
Amount of time before an XARP entry expires.  Defaults to 5 minutes.
.IP "" 8
.IP "POLL_TIMEOUT" 8
Amount of time after which \fBXARPQuerier\fR will start polling for renewal.  0 means
don't poll.  Defaults to one minute.
.IP "" 8
.IP "BROADCAST" 8
Packets sent via a FID XID will be flooded one or more interfaces and will be
forwarded to Ethernet address FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF.
.IP "" 8
.IP "BROADCAST_POLL" 8
Boolean.  If true, then send broadcast XARP polls (where an entry is about to
expire, but hasn't expired yet).  The default is to send such polls unicast to
the known Ethernet address.  Defaults to false.
.IP "" 8

.SH "NOTES"
If a host has multiple interfaces, it will need multiple
instances of \fBXARPQuerier\fR.
.PP
\fBXARPQuerier\fR uses packets' destination XIP address annotations, and can destroy
their next packet annotations.  Generated XARP queries have VLAN TCI
annotations set from the corresponding input packets.
.PP
\fBXARPQuerier\fR will send at most 10 queries a second for any XIP address.
