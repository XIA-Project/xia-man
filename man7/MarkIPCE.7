.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Expects IP packets as input.  Sets each incoming packet's ECN field to
Congestion Experienced (value 3), incrementally recalculates the IP checksum,
and passes the packet to output 0.  Packets whose ECN field is zero (not
ECN-capable) are dropped unless the optional FORCE argument is true.
