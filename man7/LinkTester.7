.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Send experimental packets over wireless link to test link
characteristics.  Packets are sent with source and destination
ethernet address SRC_ETH and DST_ETH.  The ethernet type code is
set to 0x7eee.

Keyword arguments are:
.PP


.IP "START_TIME" 8
Integer.  When to start the experiment, in seconds since the
``epoch'' (time_t).  Defaults to 5 seconds after router
initialization.
.IP "" 8
.IP "ITERATIONS" 8
Unsigned integer.  Number of iterations to the run the experiment.
In each iteration, each node sends broadcasts, then unicasts, then
broadcasts.  Defaults to 1.
.IP "" 8
.IP "SEND_FIRST" 8
Boolean.  Should this element send its packets at the beginning of
the iteration?  Otherwise, packets are sent at the end.  Defaults
to true.
.IP "" 8
.IP "PAD_TIME" 8
Unsigned integer.  Milliseconds between experiment phases.
Defaults to 10,000 (10 seconds).
.IP "" 8
.IP "UNICAST_SEND_TIME" 8

.IP "BROADCAST_SEND_TIME" 8
Unsigned integer.  Milliseconds for which to send unicast or
broadcast packets during each iteration.  Defaults to 10,000 (10
seconds).
.IP "" 8
.IP "UNICAST_PACKET_SZ" 8

.IP "BROADCAST_PACKET_SZ" 8
Unsigned integer.  Size of unicast or broadcast packets, including
ethernet header and experiment header.
.IP "" 8
.IP "UNICAST_LAMBDA" 8

.IP "BROADCAST_LAMBDA" 8
Double.  Lambda parameter for unicast or broadcast exponentially
distributed inter-packet spacing, in milliseconds.  Defaults to 1.
