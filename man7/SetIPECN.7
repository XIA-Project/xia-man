.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Expects IP packets as input and
sets their ECN bits to ECN.
This value is either a number from 0 to 3 or a keyword, namely "no",
"ect1"/"ECT(1)", "ect2"/"ECT(0)", or "ce"/"CE".
Then it incrementally recalculates the IP checksum
and passes the packet to output 0.
The ECN bits are the lower 2 bits of the IP TOS field.
