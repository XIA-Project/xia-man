.SH "NAME"
Meter \- Click element;
classifies packet stream by rate (pkt/s)
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBMeter\fR(RATE1, RATE2, ..., RATE\fIn\fR)

\fBPorts\fR: 1 input, 2 or more outputs
.br
\fBProcessing\fR: push
.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Classifies packets based on the rate of packet arrival. The rate is
measured in packets per second using an exponential weighted moving
average. (The related 
.M BandwidthMeter 7
element measures rates in bytes per
second.)
.PP
The configuration string consists of one or more rate arguments. Earlier
rates in the list must be less than later rates. A \fBMeter\fR with \fIn\fR rate
arguments will have \fIn\fR+1 outputs. It sends packets out the output
corresponding to the current rate. If the rate is less than RATE1 packets
are sent to output 0; if it is >= RATE1 but < RATE2, packets are sent to
output 1; and so on. If it is >= RATE\fIn\fR, packets are sent to output \fIn\fR.
.PP

.SH "NOTES"
The entire packet stream is sent to the output corresponding to the current
rate. If you would like the packet stream to be split, with at most RATE1
packets per second being sent out the first output and the remainder being
sent to the second output, check out 
.M RatedSplitter 7 .
.PP

.SH "EXAMPLES"
This configuration fragment drops the input stream when it is generating
more than 10,000 packets per second.
