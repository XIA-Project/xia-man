EtherPauseSource \- Click element;
creates and emits Ethernet 802.3x pause frames
.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Ethernet pause frames can be used for hardware flow control
if the receiving device supports them.  A pause frame specifies
a requested PAUSETIME for how long the receiving device should pause its
transmission.  This pause time is measured in pause quanta, where a pause
quantum equals the time it takes to
transmit 512 bits with the current link speed. For instance,
on a 1Gbps link, a quantum of 195 is equavalent to pause of 100
microseconds.  The rate of Ethernet pause frames and the pause time
can be used to achieve a desired \fIaggregate\fR link rate.
SRC must equal the address of the device sending the pause frames.
.PP
In pull mode, \fBEtherPauseSource\fR emits a packet per pull request.  In push
mode, it generates a packet every INTERVAL seconds (with millisecond
precision).  INTERVAL defaults to 1 second.
.PP
Keyword arguments are:
.PP


.IP "DST" 8
Ethernet address.  Destination address of the PAUSE frames.  Defaults to
01-80-C2-00-00-01, the special multicast address allocated for PAUSE
frames.  Can also be a specific station's address.
.IP "" 8
.IP "LIMIT" 8
Integer.  The maximum number of packets to emit.  If -1, emits packets
forever.  Defaults to -1.
.IP "" 8
.IP "ACTIVE" 8
Boolean.  If false, does not emit packets.  Defaults to true.
.IP "" 8

.SH "ELEMENT HANDLERS"



.IP "\fBcount\fR (read-only)" 5
Returns the total number of packets that have been generated.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBsrc\fR (read/write)" 5
Returns or sets the Ethernet source address.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBdst\fR (read/write)" 5
Returns or sets the Ethernet destination address.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBpausetime\fR (read/write)" 5
Returns or sets the pause time value.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBlimit\fR (read/write)" 5
Returns or sets the LIMIT parameter.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBreset_counts\fR (write)" 5
Resets the packet count.  This may cause \fBEtherPauseSource\fR to generate LIMIT
more packets.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBactive\fR (read/write)" 5
Returns or sets the ACTIVE parameter.
