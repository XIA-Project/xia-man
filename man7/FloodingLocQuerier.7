.SH "NAME"
FloodingLocQuerier \- Click element;
Sets Grid Destination location by running a flooding query protocol
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBFloodingLocQuerier\fR(ETH, IP)

\fBPorts\fR: 2 inputs, 2 outputs
.br
\fBProcessing\fR: push

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Argument I should be this host's IP address, E should be this host's
Ethernet address, and LOCINFO is a 
.M GridLocationInfo 7
element that knows
where this host is.
.PP
Expects GRID_NBR_ENCAP packets with MAC headers on input 0. If a
location is already known for the destination, the destination
location field is filled in and the packet is sent to output 0.
Otherwise the packet is saved and a flooding location query is sent
to output 1 instead, ready for FixSrcLoc, checksumming and
transmission.  If a query response arrives on input 1 for a
location that we need, the mapping is recorded and the saved Grid
packet is sent through output 0.
.PP
Input 1 expects flooding query packets, and query reply response
packets for us.  Packets must include all headers (MAC, Grid, etc.)
