.SH "NAME"
RandomSource \- Click element;
generates random packets whenever scheduled
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBRandomSource\fR(LENGTH [, LIMIT, BURST, ACTIVE, \fIKEYWORDS\fR])

\fBPorts\fR: no inputs, 1 output

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Creates packets, of the indicated length, filled with random bytes.
Packets' timestamp annotations are set to the current time. Pushes BURST such
packets out its single output every time it is scheduled (which will be
often). Stops sending after LIMIT packets are generated; but if LIMIT is
negative, sends packets forever. Will send packets only if ACTIVE is
true. (ACTIVE is true by default.) Default LIMIT is -1 (send packets
forever). Default BURST is 1.

Keyword arguments are:

.IP "LENGTH" 8
Integer. The outgoing packet will have this length.
.IP "" 8
.IP "LIMIT" 8
Integer. Same as the LIMIT argument.
.IP "" 8
.IP "BURST" 8
Integer. Same as the BURST argument.
.IP "" 8
.IP "ACTIVE" 8
Boolean. Same as the ACTIVE argument.
.IP "" 8
.IP "STOP" 8
Boolean. If true, then stop the driver once LIMIT packets are sent. Default is
false.
.IP "" 8
.IP "END_CALL" 8
A write handler called once LIMIT packets are sent. END_CALL and
STOP are mutually exclusive.
.IP "" 8
.IP "TIMESTAMP" 8
Boolean. If false, do not set the timestamp annotation on generated
packets. Defaults to true.

.SH "NOTES"
Useful for profiling and experiments.  Packets' timestamp annotations are set
to the current time.

.SH "ELEMENT HANDLERS"



.IP "\fBcount\fR (read-only)" 5
Returns the total number of packets that have been generated.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBreset\fR (write-only)" 5
Resets the number of generated packets to 0. The \fBRandomSource\fR will then
generate another LIMIT packets (if it is active).
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBlength\fR (read/write)" 5
Returns or sets the LENGTH parameter.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBlimit\fR (read/write)" 5
Returns or sets the LIMIT parameter.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBburst\fR (read/write)" 5
Returns or sets the BURST parameter.
.IP "" 5
.IP "\fBactive\fR (read/write)" 5
Makes the element active or inactive.
